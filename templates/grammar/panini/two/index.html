<h1>Two Easy Rules</h1>
<p class="note box">This lesson is for those who have finished <a href="/start">Starting Out</a>.</p>
<p>This lesson uses a noun that ends in the letter <span lang="sa">i</span>. This noun is <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>, and its case 1 singular form is <span lang="sa">vṛddhiḥ</span>. This lesson also features a new type of compound. If word 1 is A and word 2 is B, then the compound "A-B" means "A and B."</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we'll cover two of the rules featured in Panini's work. These rules help illustrate a few of his system's characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of technical terms</li>
<li>Brevity</li>
<li>Concision</li>
<li>The unintuitive arrangement of its rules</li>
</ul>
<p>We list an individial rule with three numbers: its chapter number, its section number, and its rule number. For example, the first rule of the work is described by <dfn>1.1.1</dfn>.</p>
<h2>1.1.1</h2>
<p>Chapter 1, section 1, rule 1. The rule is as follows.</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">वृद्धिरादैच्</p>
<p lang="sa">vṛddhirādaic</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is incomprehensible! Let's undo the sandhi:</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">वृद्धिः आत्-ऐच्</p>
<p lang="sa">vṛddhiḥ āt-aic</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of Panini's rules are verbless sentences. With that in mind, let's try and figure out what's going on here. We can decipher the first word quite easily: it is <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>, a technical term that refers to very strong vowels. It is in case 1. This rule, then, is likely a definition for the word <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>.</p>
<p>As we see here, <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span> is connected with <span lang="sa">āt-aic</span>, which is a compound formed by the terms <span lang="sa">āt</span> and <span lang="sa">aic</span>. <span lang="sa">aic</span> is a <span lang="sa">pratyāhāra</span> from the Shiva Sutras, and it includes both <span lang="sa">ai</span> and <span lang="sa">au</span>. This term is in case 1, so it's directly equated with the word <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>. So, <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span> refers to <span lang="sa">ai</span> and <span lang="sa">au</span> — but we still have that <span lang="sa">āt</span> left over.</p>
<p>Since the word <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span> must refer to all strong vowels, <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span> must also refer to the vowel <span lang="sa">ā</span>. But how is that fact captured by <span lang="sa">āt</span>? The truth is quite disappointing: <span lang="sa">t</span> is an <dfn lang="sa">anubandha</dfn> ("indicatory letter") that is defined near the end of 1.1. Yes, that's right: the very first rule of the Ashtadhyayi presumes that you know about Panini's system already. That's why these lessons are here: to give you enough familiarity with Panini and the Ashtadhyayi to start reading for yourself.</p>
<p>But let's come back to <span lang="sa">t</span>. What is it, and what does it do? Recall from the last lesson that the Shiva Sutras refer to long and short vowels identically. That is, there is no way to distinguish between short <span lang="sa">a</span> and long <span lang="sa">ā</span>. This indicatory <span lang="sa">t</span> lets us choose exactly what vowel we mean. <span lang="sa">at</span> indicates "<span lang="sa">a</span>" and nothing else. <span lang="sa">āt</span> indicates "<span lang="sa">ā</span>" and nothing else.</p>
<p>With that, we've decoded the rule: the word <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span> refers to <span lang="sa">ā, ai,</span> and <span lang="sa">au</span>.</p>
<p class="note box">But what about <span lang="sa">ār</span>? Panini adds this vowel to the definition later on.</p>
<p class="fact box">More technically, the indicatory <span lang="sa">t</span> refers to the vowel with the same length as the one before it. <span lang="sa">ā</span> is longer than <span lang="sa">a</span>, so <span lang="sa">āt</span> can only refer to <span lang="sa">ā</span>. According to commentators, this <span lang="sa">t</span> also extends to the vowels that follow it; that is, <span lang="sa">aic</span> refers to the versions of <span lang="sa">ai</span> and <span lang="sa">au</span> that have exactly the same length as <span lang="sa">ā</span>. Commentators argue for this behavior because they want all forms of <span lang="sa">ai</span> to have the same length. For example, <span lang="sa">ā</span> combines with <span lang="sa">ai</span> to form <span lang="sa">ai</span>. Without the stipulation that <span lang="sa">t</span> extends to the vowel that follows it, this second <span lang="sa">ai</span> could be considered longer than the first one. But this is a rather pedantic point to make.</p>
<h2>1.1.2</h2>
<p>Chapter 1, section 1, rule 2. The rule is as follows.</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">अदेङ्गुणः</p>
<p lang="sa">adeṅguṇaḥ</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, it's a bit easier to undo the sandhi.</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">अत्-एङ् गुणः</p>
<p lang="sa">at-eṅ guṇaḥ</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This rule is very similar to the one before it, and the analysis is almost the same. This is a verbless sentence that defines the word <span lang="sa">guṇa</span>. <span lang="sa">eṅ</span> is a <span lang="sa">pratyāhāra</span> from the Shiva Sutras, and it includes both <span lang="sa">e</span> and <span lang="sa">o</span>. <span lang="sa">at</span> is the vowel <span lang="sa">a</span>. Remember: the indicatory <span lang="sa">t</span> is used to distinguish between short <span lang="sa">a</span> and long <span lang="sa">ā</span>.</p>
<p>With that, we've decoded the rule: the word <span lang="sa">guṇa</span> refers to <span lang="sa">a, e,</span> and <span lang="sa">o</span>.</p>
<p class="note box">But what about <span lang="sa">ar</span>? Panini adds this vowel to the definition later on.</p>
<p>From these two rules, we can understand one of the important principles that governs the Ashtadhyayi. The first rule defines <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>, which was put at the beginning of the line. Similarly, the second rule defines <span lang="sa">guṇa</span> — but it was put at the <em>end</em> of the line and <em>not</em> at the beginning.</p>
<p>In almost all of Panini's rules, the term that is being defined is put at the <strong>end of the rule</strong>, even if another arrangement would be briefer (like <span lang="sa">guṇo'deṅ</span>). Brevity is important, but it is not always the most important concern. But then we have to wonder why <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span> was put at the beginning of its rule. One explanation is that this arrangement makes the first two rules of the Ashtadhyayi conform to the pattern of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shloka" lang="sa">śloka</a> meter. Another is that the word <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>, which can mean "growth" or "prosperity," was an auspicious way to start the Ashtadhyayi.</p>
<p>In a recent paper, Stanford linguist Paul Kiparsky argued that Panini structures his rules in a way that avoids ambiguity as much as possible. The title of Kiparsky's paper is a good guiding principle that you should keep in mind while reading Panini:</p>
<p class="rule box">Panini is slick, but he isn't mean.</p>
