<h1>Consonant Nouns</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If the word <span lang="sa">bhagavadgītā</span> sums up the chapter, then the word <span lang="sa">bhagavat</span> sums up this part of it. The word is formed by attaching a secondary suffix to the noun <span lang="sa">bhaga</span>, but that's nothing new. What is new, however, is how this noun is used. For, unlike all of the other noun stems we've seen, <span lang="sa">bhagavat</span> ends in a consonant, <strong>not</strong> a vowel. Many of the most common and popular Sanskrit terms — including <span lang="sa">yogin</span>, <span lang="sa">karman</span>, and <span lang="sa">bhagavat</span> — end in consonants.</p>
<p>The difficulty of studying these <dfn>consonant nouns</dfn> is that several of their endings differ from the vowel noun endings. But this is a small difficulty, and it is easily overcome. This is because all consonant nouns use <strong>the same endings</strong>! We only have to study one set of endings to unlock thousands of new nouns.</p>
<h2>The noun endings</h2>
<p>Here are the endings that all consonant nouns use. The parentheses (<dfn>—</dfn>) indicate that no ending is used. The question marks (<dfn>???</dfn>) indicates that the form varies from noun to noun. </p>

<p>Note that the dual and plural endings are almost identical to what we've seen so far; the biggest differences are in the singular.</p>
<h2>An Inserted Nasal Sound</h2>
<p>In the neuter plural of cases 1, 2, and 7, the stem has a nasal sounded inserted into it:</p>
<p class="rule box">The final vowel is lengthened, and <span lang="sa">n</span> is added right after it. <span lang="sa">i</span> is added to the end of the word
<p>This rule may seem bizarre and difficult to remember. But the task is not so hard because you have already seen this rule applied before, in neuter words like <span lang="sa">phala</span>. Note, too, that the dual ending is not new either.</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">फल + इ → फला + न् + इ → फलानि</p>
<p lang="sa">phala + i → phalā + n + i → phalāni</p>
<p>fruits</p></li>
<li><p class="dev">फल + ई → फले</p>
<p lang="sa">phala + ī → phale</p>
<p>two fruits</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get started.</p></p>
