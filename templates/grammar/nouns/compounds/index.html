<h1>Other Compounds</h1>
<h2>Introduction!</h2>
<p>If the word <span lang="sa">bhagavadgītā</span> sums up the chapter, then the relation between <span lang="sa">bhagavat</span> and <span lang="sa">gītā</span> sums up this part of it.</p>
<p>We already know that the word <span lang="sa">bhagavadgītā</span> is a <a href="/start/words/tatpurusha">case 6 tatpurusha</a> compound, but we have not studied the other parts of the tatpurusha in detail. Moreover, we have only studied <strong>one</strong> of the four Sanskrit compounds.</p>
<p>But how, really, does one compound differ from another? To understand this, we have to start with the idea that a compound is either an <strong>idea</strong> or a <strong>qualifier</strong> of some idea. (The word "idea" is used here because not all compounds are nouns, and the word "qualifier" means anything from "characteristic" to "state" and "behavior.") Similary, each of the compound's two <em>words</em> can be either an idea or a qualifier of that idea. To review, a compound has two (2) words, each of which can be one of two (2) types. So, we have <strong>four</strong> (4) different types of compounds.</p>
<p>Let's try to classify the tatpurusha in this scheme. To do so, let's turn to an example: <span lang="sa">dharmakṣetra</span>, a compound we've seen many times. A <span lang="sa">dharmakṣetra</span> is still a <span lang="sa">kṣetra</span>; so, <span lang="sa">kṣetra</span> represents the "idea" of the compound. But a <span lang="sa">dharmakṣetra</span> is in no way a sort of <span lang="sa">dharma</span>; so, <span lang="sa">dharma</span> represents the "qualifier" of the compound. We can place the tatpurusha accordingly:</p>
<table class="blue">
<tr><th> </th><th>Word 2: Idea</th><th>Word 2: Qualifier</th></tr>
<tr><th>Word 1: Idea</th><td>???</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><th>Word 1: Qualifier</th><td>tatpurusha</td><td>???</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In this chapter, we will study the three other types of compounds and fill in the chart above. But to understand these compounds, we must also understand some other parts of Sanskrit grammar. We will study these parts, too.</p>
<h3>Verb prefixes</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we will study 6 more prefixes, bringing our total to 18. There are two others beyond these 18, but they are uncommon. As a reminder, you can use the <a href="/references/lists/prefixes">prefixes list</a> in the References section of the site if you want to review.</p>
