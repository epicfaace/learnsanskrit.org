<p class="desc">In the modern day, we usually use the term "Hinduism" to broadly refer to an extremely large and diverse group of religious practices. But as you might be able to guess, the word "Hinduism" is itself quite new. The term comes from the word "Hindu," which itself is a Persian form of the Sanskrit word <span lang="sa">sindhu</span>. <span lang="sa">sindhu</span> is the ancient name of the Indus River, and it was the river that most of India's conquerors first saw as they proceeded into the country.</p>
<p class="desc">So, what term did the ancient Indians use to describe what we call Hinduism today? This is a very good question, but it is also misleading; for the word "Hinduism" includes dozens of schools that were once fierce rivals, and these schools often had little in common with each other. Eventually, the term <dfn lang="sa">āstika</dfn> was used. This term is derived from a word that means "it is." In this case, "it" refers to the Vedas; the <span lang="sa">āstika</span> schools, to varying extents, all accept the authority of the Vedas. This term is largely used in contrast with the <span lang="sa">nāstika</span> schools, which rejected the authority of the Vedas. But you should be careful with the words <span lang="sa">āstika</span> and <span lang="sa">nāstika</span>, because they hide an important fact: <span lang="sa">āstika</span> and <span lang="sa">nāstika</span> schools have influenced each other for thousands of years, and not all schools can be sorted into one group or the other. For example, the foundational text of yoga borrows Buddhist and Jain terminology, and it makes very little reference to the Vedas.</p>
<p class="desc">Traditionally, there are six <span lang="sa">āstika</span> schools. Along with yoga, the most popular today is <dfn lang="sa">vedānta</dfn>, which primarily deals with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishad">Upanishads</a>. The name literally means "end of the Vedas," and it is divided into many separate sub-schools; of these, the most famous and popular is <dfn lang="sa">advaita vedānta</dfn>, or "nondualistic <span lang="sa">vedānta</span>." It summarizes its philosophy as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma">Brahman</a> is truth. The world is a deception. The soul is Brahman itself, and nothing more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="desc">Given this, you can see how the mantra above becomes significant. It completely equates the soul ("I") with Brahman ("it" or, less commonly, "he"). It is usually chanted with one syllable inhaled and the other exhaled. Sources disagree as to which is which.</p>
<p class="desc">But there's still more to discuss about this mantra. One interesting thing about it is its association with the <span lang="sa">haṃsa</span> bird. As a masculine -<span lang="sa">a</span> noun, <span lang="sa">haṃsa</span> is <span lang="sa">haṃsaḥ</span> in the case 1 singular. When repeated, we get <span lang="sa">haṃsaḥ haṃsaḥ haṃsaḥ …</span>, which becomes <span lang="sa">haṃso haṃso haṃso …</span>. This result sounds identical to the mantra above, which when repeated would give us <span lang="sa">so 'haṃ so 'haṃ so 'haṃ …</span>. Partly because of this, <span lang="sa">haṃsa</span> birds are an important symbol in <span lang="sa">advaita vedānta</span>.</p>
<p class="desc">With just a small bit of Sanskrit, you've unraveled the mystery of this very famous mantra.</p>
