similar queries. Here is an approximate traffic breakdown by locale:

Leaving aside tools, our most popular content is our beginner-friendly grammar
guide. Based on our analytics and the emails we receive from readers, our
community is primarily one of "informal learners" who study outside of a
traditional or university setting.


Technical design
----------------

`learnsanskrit.org` is served as a static website. Static websites are fast,
stable, and don't require any monitoring, so they're perfect for a project like
ours.

Internally, the site is a Flask app and has access to normal Flask features. At
deployment time, however, we use `flask-freeze` to convert all output to flat
files.

All of the site content is written in SML, a custom markup language that is
lightweight and simple. For details, see `lso/sml`.
