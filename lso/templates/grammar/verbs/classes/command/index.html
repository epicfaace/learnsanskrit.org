<h1>The Command Mood</h1>
<p class="alternatives">Also known as: present imperative, <span lang="sa">ājñā</span> ("command"), <span lang="sa">loṭ</span></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Back in Nouns, we studied just three of the many forms in the command mood. These three forms applied only to <span lang="sa">parasmaipada</span> verbs from the simple verb classes. We have many more endings to study. Fortunately, these endings are almost identical to the ones we've been studying.</p>
<h2>Endings</h2>
<p>Each group of endings will be compared with its counterpart in the ordinary past tense.</p>
<h3>P Endings</h3>
<p>The simple verb classes and the complex verb classes use the same set of endings. Let's take a look at the endings:</p>

<p class="note box">The first-person endings have lost the <span lang="sa">visarga</span>. Note the change from <span lang="sa">m</span> to <span lang="sa">n</span> in the first-person singular.</p>
<p>Here is an example for the complex verbs. The third-person singular uses the strong stem, and all three of the first-person forms use the strong stem as well.</p>

<h3>A Endings</h3>
<p>Here are the A endings for verbs from the simple verb classes.</p>
<div class="hideDouble">

<p>Now, here are the A endings for verbs from the complex verb classes. The endings are almost exactly the same.</p>
<div class="hideDouble">
{% include 'include/charts/c-su-comm-a.html' %}</div>
<div class="note box">
<p>These are the differences between the two sets of endings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="sa">ntām → atām</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We have seen this sort of change twice: in the present <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> (<span lang="sa">nte → ate</span>) and in the past <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> (<span lang="sa">nta → ata</span>).</p>
</div>
