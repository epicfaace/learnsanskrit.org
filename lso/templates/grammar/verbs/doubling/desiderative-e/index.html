<p>The word <span lang="sa">ataḥ</span> is extremely significant. Commentaries on the Brahma Sutras contain long passages explaining both why the word is here and how it should be understood.

<p>For the sake of perceiving words and meanings I hail the parents of the world,<br/>
	the supreme lord and Parvati, (ever) connected like word and meaning.
	</p><p>
	What is the race born from the sun to the small domain of (my) intellect?<br/>
	(Truly,) I wish to deludedly [lit. "because of delusion"] cross the uncrossable ocean with a raft.
	</p><p>
	A fool longing for the fame of poets, I'll go to ridicule,<br/>
	like a dwarf with hands greedily [lit. "because of greed"] uplifted for fruits obtainable (only) by the tall.
	</p><p>
	Or perhaps I have a path in this race (after all), a door made of speech by the sages before (me),<br/>
	as would a string in a jewel pierced with a diamond pin.
	</p><p>
	Those who are pure from birth, whose labors (are done) until fruition,<br/>
	who were lords of the land up to the ocean (itself), who had chariot paths (right) up to heaven,
	</p><p>
	who sacrificed to the fire according to injunction, whose supplicants were satisfied in every desire,<br/>
	who punished according to the crime, who were alert [or, "awake"] at the right times,
	</p><p>
	who collected wealth (just) to give it away [lit. "for giving away"], who were of measured speech for the sake of truth,<br/>
	who wished to conquer only for glory, who married only for progeny,

<p>After this verse, the actual narration starts. A more poetic translation of these ten verses, created by the late Sanskrit scholar Arthur Ryder, is below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	God Shiva and his mountain bride,
	Like word and meaning unified,<br/>
	The world's great parents, I beseech
	To join fit meaning to my speech.
	</p><p>
	How great is Raghu's solar line!
	How feebly small are powers of mine!<br/>
	As if upon the ocean's swell
	I launched a puny cockle-shell.
	</p><p>
	The fool who seeks a poet's fame
	Must look for ridicule and blame,<br/>
	Like tiptoe dwarf who fain would try
	To pluck the fruit for giants high.
	</p><p>
	Yet I may enter through the door
	That mightier poets pierced of yore;<br/>
	A thread may pierce a jewel, but
	Must follow where the diamond cut.
	</p><p>
	Of kings who lived as saints from birth,
	Who ruled to ocean-shore on earth,<br/>
	Who toiled until success was given,
	Whose chariots stormed the gates of heaven,
	</p><p>
	Whose pious offerings were blest,
	Who gave his wish to every guest,<br/>
	Whose punishments were as the crimes,
	Who woke to guard the world betimes,
	</p><p>
	Who sought, that they might lavish, pelf,
	Whose measured speech was truth itself,<br/>
	Who fought victorious wars for fame,
	Who loved in wives the mother's name,
	</p><p>
	Who studied all good arts as boys,
	Who loved, in manhood, manhood's joys,<br/>
	Whose age was free from worldly care,
	Who breathed their lives away in prayer,
	</p><p>
	Of these I sing, of Raghu's line,
	Though weak mine art, and wisdom mine.<br/>
	Forgive these idle stammerings
	And think: For virtue's sake he sings.
	</p><p>
	The good who hear me will be glad
	To pluck the good from out the bad;<br/>
	When ore is proved by fire, the loss
	Is not of purest gold, but dross.
