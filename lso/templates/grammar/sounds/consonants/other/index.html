<h1>Other Consonants</h1>
<div class="floating image" style="width: 256px"><img alt="Points of Pronunciation" src="/static/img/points_of_pronunciation.png"/><p>The five points of pronunciation, for quick reference.</p></div>
<p>Now we will study the last eight consonants. These consonants use the same points of pronunciation as the stops and nasals from the previous lesson.</p>
<h2>Semivowels</h2>
<p>The consonants in this group are halfway between vowels and consonants. For that reason, they are called the <dfn>semivowels</dfn>, where "semi-" means "half." Like the vowels, the semivowels are <strong>voiced and unaspirated</strong>. Also, they are produced by continuous air flow out of the mouth. However, we produce these sounds by <strong>suppressing</strong> the flow of air at the point of pronunciation.</p>

<p class="note box">The semivowel <span lang="sa">r</span> has essentially the same pronunciation as the vowel <span lang="sa">ṛ</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the semivowels has a different point of pronunciation: <span lang="sa">ya</span> uses the hard palate, <span lang="sa">ra</span> is a retroflex consonant, and <span lang="sa">la</span> uses the teeth. <span lang="sa">va</span> is a bit different; it mainly uses the lips, but it also requires the use of the teeth. <span lang="sa">va</span> is halfway between the English "va" and the English "wa."</p>
<h2>The "s"-sounds</h2>
<p>The consonants in this group are all varieties of the hissing sound that you hear in words like "Sanskrit" and "sherpa." For simplicity's sake, let's just call these the <dfn>"s"-sounds</dfn>. Just like the semivowels, the "s"-sounds in this group are produced by <strong>suppressing</strong> the flow of air at the point of pronunciation. But, these sounds are <strong>not</strong> like the semivowels, as you can hear below.</p>
<table class="blue">
<tr><th>Letter</th><th>Approximation</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td class="big" lang="sa">śa</td><td>---</td><td><div class="audio"><audio controls="" src="/static/audio/sha.OGG"><embed autoplay="false" height="20" src="/static/audio/sha.wav" width="200"/></audio><p></p></div>
</td></tr>
<tr><td class="big" lang="sa">ṣa</td><td>---</td><td><div class="audio"><audio controls="" src="/static/audio/shha.OGG"><embed autoplay="false" height="20" src="/static/audio/shha.wav" width="200"/></audio><p></p></div>

<p><strong>The "s"-sounds are unvoiced.</strong> Each has a different point of pronunciation: <span lang="sa">śa</span> uses the hard palate, <span lang="sa">ṣa</span> is a retroflex consonant, and <span lang="sa">sa</span> uses the teeth. <span lang="sa">śa</span> and <span lang="sa">ṣa</span> have no English equivalents.</p>
<p class="note box">One reader has offered a helpful way to make the English "sh" sound more like the Sanskrit <span lang="sa">śa</span> and <span lang="sa">ṣa</span>. To better approximate <span lang="sa">śa</span>, try saying a word like "petshop." Make sure to leave your tongue in the "t" position as you say the "sh" that follows. To better approximate <span lang="sa">ṣa</span>, trying saying a word like "friction" or "hershey." Make sure to leave your tongue in the "r" position as you say the "sh" that follows. Your results may depend on your dialect of English.</p>
<h2><span lang="sa">ha</span></h2>
<table class="blue">
<tr><th>Letter</th><th>Approximation</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td class="big" lang="sa">ha</td><td>voiced "h"</td><td><div class="audio"><audio controls="" src="/static/audio/ha.OGG"><embed autoplay="false" height="20" src="/static/audio/ha.wav" width="200"/></audio><p></p></div>

<p>This sound is a <strong>voiced</strong> "h" sound, and it is very easy to produce. If you breathe out and make your breath voiced, you'll hear something like "haaa." That "h" is the same as <span lang="sa">ha</span>. <span lang="sa">ha</span> is the same breathy sound that you hear after the voiced aspirated consonants (<span lang="sa">gha</span>, <span lang="sa">jha</span>, <span lang="sa">ḍha</span>, <span lang="sa">dha</span>, and <span lang="sa">bha</span>).</p>
<p><span lang="sa">ha</span> is said to be pronounced at the soft palate.</p>
<p class="note box">A sound like <span lang="sa">bha</span> is not just <span lang="sa">ba</span> + <span lang="sa">ha</span>. It is its own sound, and it should not be confused with <span lang="sa">ha</span> on its own. So, if some rule says "<span lang="sa">ha</span> acts in this way," then the rule does not apply to <span lang="sa">bha</span> or any other voiced and aspirated consonant. This is a subtle distinction that IAST makes quite confusing.</p>
<h2>A Handy Term</h2>
<p>As we move forward in our study of Sanskrit, we'll need some way to talk about specific groups of sounds. This is because Sanskrit sounds often change in very particular ways. If we use the right terms, it will be much easier to describe these changes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let me introduce the Sanskrit word <dfn lang="sa">varga</dfn>, which means "division" or "category." This word is used to describe the consonant groups that we've just finished studying: the soft palate consonants, the semivowels, the "s"-sounds, and so on. To refer to one of these sets, we take the first consonant from the set and put it in front of the word <span lang="sa">varga</span>. Since it's so simple to just put a letter in front of the word <span lang="sa">varga</span>, you don't need to know seven separate terms: you can just use different letters, as you can see below.</p>
<dl class="blue" lang="sa">
<dt class="title" lang="en">Varga</dt><dd class="title" lang="en">Letters</dd>
<dt>kavarga</dt><dd>ka kha ga gha ṅa</dd>
<dt>cavarga</dt><dd>ca cha ja jha ña</dd>
<dt>ṭavarga</dt><dd>ṭa ṭha ḍa ḍha ṇa</dd>
<dt>tavarga</dt><dd>ta tha da dha na</dd>
<dt>pavarga</dt><dd>pa pha ba bha ma</dd>
<dt>yavarga</dt><dd>ya ra la va</dd>
<dt>śavarga</dt><dd>śa ṣa sa ha</dd>
</dl>
<p><span lang="sa">ha</span> is considered to be a part of <span lang="sa">śavarga</span>. But, you must remember that <span lang="sa">ha</span> is different from the other letters in <span lang="sa">śavarga</span>. <span lang="sa">ha</span> is both voiced and aspirated, but the others are both <strong>un</strong>voiced and <strong>un</strong>aspirated. For that reason, I'll usually use the term "s"-sound to refer to <span lang="sa">śa, ṣa,</span> and <span lang="sa">sa</span>.</p>
<h2>An important final note on consonants</h2>
<p>Before we started our study of the consonants, I mentioned that we can give names to these consonants by adding the vowel <span lang="sa">a</span> after them. This is an ancient and common scheme, and almost all Sanskrit students are familiar with it. However, this scheme can also make descriptions confusing. For example, consider a description like this:</p>
<p class="rule box">When <span lang="sa">ja</span> is added to <span lang="sa">uda</span>, we get a word that means "water-born," i.e. "lotus."</p>
<p>So, what is the word for "lotus": <strong lang="sa">udaja</strong> or <strong lang="sa">udaj</strong>? The description is ambiguous because <span lang="sa">ja</span> refers to both the consonant and some word meaning "born." For that reason, and from now on, this guide will refer to single consonants without the <span lang="sa">a</span> sound that follows them.</p>
<h2>The Alphabet</h2>
<p>Our alphabet is almost done! Add the symbols above in order.</p>
<ul lang="sa" style="font-size: 1.5em;">
<li>a ā, i ī, u ū, ṛ ṝ, e ai, o au</li>
<li>ka kha ga gha ṅa</li>
<li>ca cha ja jha ña</li>
<li>ṭa ṭha ḍa ḍha ṇa</li>
<li>ta tha da dha na</li>
<li>pa pha ba bha ma</li>
<li>ya ra la va</li>
<li>śa ṣa sa ha</li>
</ul>
