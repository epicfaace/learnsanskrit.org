<h1><span lang="sa-iast">Ātmanepada</span></h1>
<p class="alternatives">Also known as: the middle voice</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>All of the verbs we've learned so far are usually called <dfn lang="sa">parasmaipada</dfn>. The word literally means "word for another," and it usually describes two kinds of verbs: verbs of activity (go, walk, wander, ask, stand, steal, find) and verbs used with an object (steal, push, emit). The traditional definition is that the result of the action does not go to the one who acts. So, they are "other-serving" verbs, or verbs <strong>for another.</strong></p>
<p>I mention the word <span lang="sa">parasmaipada</span> as a handy term for the verbs we've studied. In this lesson, we'll study verbs of a different kind. These verbs are called <dfn lang="sa">ātmanepada</dfn>, meaning "word for the self." The traditional definition is that the "fruit of action," meaning the result, goes to the one who acts. Hence, they are "self-serving" verbs, or verbs "for the self."</p>
<p>We can think of the <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> verbs as <strong>reflexive</strong> verbs since the result of the action, whatever it is, goes back to whatever acted in the first place. For illustration, consider the verb <span lang="sa">pac</span>, meaning "cook," in the examples below.</p>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">पचति</p>
<p lang="sa">pacati</p>
<p>He cooks (generally, or for somebody else).</p></li>
<li><p class="dev">पचते</p>
<p lang="sa">pacate</p>
<p>He cooks (for himself).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since these new terms are all quite long, I tend to abbreviate them: <span lang="sa">parasmaipada</span> will be <dfn>P</dfn> and <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> will be <dfn>A</dfn>. There are some verbs that are both P and A verbs; such verbs mean the same thing regardless of which is used.</p>
<p class="note box">Up above, I wrote that these verbs are called <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> because the "fruit of action," meaning the result, goes to the one who acts. But the late Sanskrit scholar Michael Coulson disputes that this is actually the case. <q>Except in a few instances,</q> he writes, <q>the underlying implication is so blurred that it is not worth pursuing. It must rather be taken as a fact of the language that some verbs are found only in the <span lang="sa">parasmaipada</span>, a few only in the <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> …</q> Even if this is the case, it is certainly true that the verbs in <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> are less likely to require an object.</p>
<h2>The present tense</h2>
<p>P and A verbs differ only in their endings. Both P verbs and A verbs are sorted into the ten verb classes, and both P verbs and A verbs form their stems according to the rules we've already seen. Again, the <strong>only</strong> difference between P and A verbs is in the endings that are used.</p>
<p>The <span lang="sa">ātmanepada</span> endings are very similar to the <span lang="sa">parasmaipada</span> endings. You can see this in the behavior of the verb <span lang="sa">labh</span>, an <span lang="sa">a+</span> verb that means "obtain."</p>

<p>Apart from the change in the 1st person singular, these changes are regular and easy to remember.</p>

<h2>Devanagari: Vowel Marking</h2>
<p>Recall that Devanagari consonants are automatically followed by the <span lang="sa">a</span> vowel sound. One such consonant is <span class="dev">त</span> (<span lang="sa">ta</span>). This is true for all of the consonants in Devanagari. But how do we write <span lang="sa">ti</span> or <span lang="sa">tu</span>? How do we just say <span lang="sa">t</span>? We do so by adding marks to the original <span class="dev">त</span>. These marks indicate the type of vowel sound that follows the consonant. All consonants use the same set of marks.</p>
<dl class="blue letters" lang="sa">
<dt class="title">देवनागरी</dt><dd class="title" lang="en">IAST</dd>
<dt>त</dt><dd>ta</dd><dt>ता</dt><dd>tā</dd><dt>ति</dt><dd>ti</dd><dt>ती</dt><dd>tī</dd>
<dt>तु</dt><dd>tu</dd><dt>तू</dt><dd>tū</dd><dt>तृ</dt><dd>tṛ</dd><dt>तॄ</dt><dd>tṝ</dd>
<dt>ते</dt><dd>te</dd><dt>तै</dt><dd>tai</dd><dt>तो</dt><dd>to</dd><dt>तौ</dt><dd>tau</dd>
<dt>तं</dt><dd>taṃ</dd><dt>तः</dt><dd>taḥ</dd><dt>त्</dt><dd>t</dd><dt>र्त</dt><dd>rta</dd>
</dl>
<p class="note box">Note that the consonant <span lang="sa">r</span> can be used like a vowel mark. It is always used this way when it appears in front of consonants.</p>
<p>The single stroke that makes <span lang="sa">ta</span> become <span lang="sa">t</span> is called the <dfn lang="sa">virāma</dfn>. The other symbols do not have names, but we could just call them <dfn>vowel marks</dfn> for convenience. In Devanagari, vowels appear both as proper letters (like <span class="dev">ई</span>) and as vowel marks (like <span class="dev">ी</span>). But the vowel mark is used wherever possible. Even though each vowel has its own Devanagari letter, these letters are only used when a vowel starts a syllable. As you can imagine, this fact makes these letters quite rare.</p>
<p class="fact box">Devanagari is one of many scripts that use consonants with a "default" vowel sound. Such a script is called an <dfn>abugida</dfn>. The word "abugida" comes from from Ge'ez, a Semitic language once spoken in Ethiopia.</p>
