{title Introduction}

Almost all of chapters 4 and 5 of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} focuses specifically on
the {s pratyaya}s (suffixes) that we add directly to a {s prAtipadika}. As a
reminder, a {s prAtipadika} is defined as follows:

{rule

arthavadadhAturapratyayaH prAtipadikam | 1.2.45
arthavat a-dhAtuH a-pratyayaH prAtipadikam
A meaningful [term] that is neither a `dhAtu (verb root) nor a `pratyaya
(suffix), [nor a term ending in a `pratyaya, is called] `prAtipadika,

kRttaddhitasamAsAzca | 1.2.46
kRt-taddhita-samAsAH ca
and [terms ending with] `kRt or `taddhita [`pratyaya_s], as well as `samAsa_s
(compounds), [are called `prAtipadika].

}

We can add three types of {s pratyaya}s to a {s prAtipadika}. The first type is
the {s sup-pratyaya}, which creates {s subanta}s (nominals):

{ex

rAma + [su~] > rAmaH
Rama

nau + [TA] > nAvA
with a boat

}

The second type is the {s strI-pratyaya}, which creates feminine {s
prAtipadika}s to which we can add {s sup-pratyaya}s:

{ex

kartR + [GIp] > kartrI
(female) doer

}

And the third type, the {s-dfn taddhita-pratyaya}, is any other {s pratyaya} we
could add. {s taddhita-pratyaya}s create {s prAtipadika}s (stems) that
eventually become {s subanta}s:

{ex

aditi + [aN] > Aditya
a descendant of Aditi; a `deva

sundara + [tarap] > sundaratara
more beautiful

}

{h General rules for {s taddhita}s}

{s taddhita-pratyaya}s are introduced under the two {s pratyaya adhikAra}s that
we've already seen:

{rule

pratyayaH | 3.1.1
_
&hellip; is a `pratyaya (suffix).

parazca | 3.1.2
paraH ca
&hellip; and [it is inserted] after [the base].

}

In addition, {s taddhita-pratyaya}s are scoped to appear only after {s
prAtipadika}s and feminine bases:

{rule

GyApprAtipadikAt | 4.1.1 
GI-Ap-prAtipadikAt
After [the `strI-pratyaya_s] `GI or `Ap or after a `prAtipadika, &hellip;

taddhitAH | 4.1.76
_
&hellip; is called `taddhita.

}

Traditionally, a {s taddhita} is a way to condense a multi-word expression.
For example, if we start with an expression like:

{ex

upagoH apatyam
a descendant of Upagu

}

Then we can replace the helping word with a {s taddhita}:

{ex

upagoH + apatyam > upagoH + [aN]
a descendant of Upagu

}

By using rule 2.4.71, we can delete the {s sup-pratyaya} in {s upagoH}:

{rule

supo dhAtuprAtipadikayoH | 2.4.71
supaH dhAtu-prAtipadikayoH
A `sup followed by a `dhAtu or a `prAtipadika [is replaced by `luk].

}

to create the following result:

{ex

upagoH + aN > [upagu] + aN
a descendant of Upagu

}

Then we apply the normal sound change rules for {s taddhita}s to get our final
result:

{ex

upaguH + aN > [aupagavaH]
a descendant of Upagu

}

But if we start with such a multi-word expression, which word do we add the {s
taddhita} to? Simply, it is the subordinate one:

{rule

samarthAnAM prathamAdvA | 4.1.82
samarthAnAm prathamAt vA
Among syntactically related [terms], optionally after the first &hellip;

}

Together, these five {s adhikAra} rules mean "&hellip; is optionally added as a
{s taddhita-pratyaya} after either a {s prAtipadika} or the {s pratyaya}s {s
GI} and {s Ap}, if that term is subordinate in the syntactic relationship."


{h Sound changes}

{s taddhita-pratyaya}s are neither {s sArvadhAtuka} nor {s ArdhadhAtuka}, so
they do not cause {s guNa} changes by {a-cite 7.3.84}. By default, they cause
no sound changes.

However, {s taddhita}s are still able to cause {s vRddhi} changes, per rules
7.2.117 and 7.2.118:

{rule

taddhiteSvacAmAdeH | 7.2.117
taddhiteSu acAm AdeH
The first vowel [of an `aGga becomes `vRddhi] if followed by a
`taddhita-pratyaya [that is `Jit or `Nit],

kiti ca | 7.2.118
_
Likewise if [the `taddhita-pratyaya] is `kit.

}

Additionally, {s taddhita}s might cause some small changes to the vowel they
follow. The three rules below use a {s saMjJA} called {s bha}, which roughly
refers to an {s aGga} followed by a vowel or {s y}:

{rule

orguNaH | 6.4.146
oH guNaH
[The last sound of a `bha followed by a `taddhita], if it is `u, is replaced
with its `guNa.

Dhe lopo'kadrvAH | 6.4.147
Dhe lopaH a-kadrvAH
Except for `kadrU, [the last `u of a `bha followed by a `taddhita] undergoes
`lopa when followed by [a `pratyaya beginning with] `Dha.

yasyeti ca | 6.4.148
i-a-sya Iti ca
The last `i and `a [of a `bha followed by a `taddhita] undergoes `lopa, [and
likewise] when followed by [a `pratyaya beginning with] `I.

}

We will see examples of these rules in the lessons to come.
