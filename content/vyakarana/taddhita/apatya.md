{title {s apatya}}

Many different {s taddhita}s convey the sense of {s apatya} ("offspring"). In
this lesson, we'll consider some of these {s taddhita}s and learn about the
sound changes they cause.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

In addition to the usual {s adhikAra}s for {s taddhita}s, we have two more to
consider. The first states that {s aN} is a "default" {s pratyaya} when no
other is specified:

{rule

prAgdIvyato'N | 4.1.83
prAk dIvyataH aN
Up to the rule containing `dIvyati (i.e. 4.4.2), `aN-pratyaya &hellip;

}

And the second starts the {s apatya} section:

{rule

tasyApatyam | 4.1.92
tasya apatyam
In the sense of "the offspring of," &hellip;

}

{h {s aN}}

Because it is {s Nit}, {s aN} will cause {s vRddhi} changes to the base's first
vowel.

{h {s iJ}}

{s iJ} is used in the sense of {s apatya} after bases ending with short {s a}:

{rule

ata iJ | 4.1.95
ataH iJ
After [a base ending in] `a, `iJ [is an optional `taddhita-pratyaya conveying
the sense of "offspring"].

}

Because it is {s Jit}, {s iJ} will cause {s vRddhi} changes to the base's first
vowel.


{h {s Dhak}}

{rule

strIbhyo Dhak | 4.1.120
strIbhyaH Dhak
After feminine [stems], `Dhak [is an optional `taddhita-pratyaya conveying
the sense of "offspring"].

}

Here, the {s D} in {s Dhak} is a shorthand that we can expand with rule 7.1.2:

{rule

AyaneyInIyinaH phaDhakhacchaghAm pratyayAdInAM | 7.1.2
Ayan-ey-In-Iy-inaH pha-Dha-kha-cha-ghAm pratyaya-AdInAm
The initial `pha, `Dha, `kha, `cha, and `gha of a `pratyaya are replaced,
respectively, with `Ayan, `ey, `In, `Iy, and `in.

}

Thus the true {s pratyaya} is {s eya}, with {s k} as an {s it} letter. This {s
taddhita} will then cause a {s vRddhi} change to the first vowel of the base,
like so:

{ex

vinatA + [Dhak] > vainateya
offspring of Vinata

}

{aside

{h {s Dhak} and the {s it-saMjJA} rules}

By rule {a-cite 1.3.7} and {a-cite 1.3.9}, we would normally delete the first
{s Dh} of {s Dhak}. But if we did so, then rule 7.1.2 above would have no
scope to apply and would be worthless ({s vyartha}).

Since every rule in the system is stated for a reason, we infer that rule 1.3.7
does not apply to any {s pratyaya}s that are in scope for rule 7.1.2.

}

{h Sample {s prakriyA}s}

Our first example uses {s aN} and rule {a-cite 6.4.146}:

{prakriya

upagoH apatyam |
upagoH aN | 4.1.92
upagu aN | 2.4.71
upagu a | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
aupagu a | 7.2.117
aupago a | 6.4.146
aupagava | 6.1.78

}


Our next uses {s iJ} and rule {a-cite 6.4.148}:

{prakriya

dazarathasya apatyam |
dazarathasya iJ | 4.1.95
dazaratha iJ | 2.4.71
dazaratha i | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
dAzaratha i | 7.2.117
dAzarathi | 6.4.148

}

And this one uses {s Dhak} and again uses rule 6.4.148:

{prakriya

vinatAyAH apatyam |
vinatAyAH Dhak | 4.1.120
vinatA Dhak | 2.4.71
vinatA Dha | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
vinatA eya | 7.1.2
vainatA eya | 7.2.118
vainateya | 6.4.148


}
