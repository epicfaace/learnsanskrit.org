{title {s matu~p}}

The {s-dfn matu~p-pratyaya} creates common words like {s hanumAn} and {s
bhagavAn}. It has many specific use cases, but here is the general pattern:

{rule

tadasyAstyasminniti matup | 5.2.94
tat asya asti asmin iti matu~p
[The `taddhita-pratyaya] `matu~p [is optionally introduced after a `prAtipadika
or the `GI and `Ap `pratyaya_s after a term denoting] that which one possesses
or contains.

}


{h Sound changes}

{s matu~p} generally causes no sound changes. The major exception is that {s
mat} becomes {s vat} when it follows certain sounds.

Here is the specific rule from the {s asiddha} section of the {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī}:

{rule

mAdupadhAyAzca matorvo'yavAdibhyaH | 8.2.9
m-At upadhAyAH ca matoH vaH a-yavAdibhyaH
After the sounds `m, `a, and `A, even if penultimate, [the first letter of the
`pratyaya] `matu~ becomes `v if not following an item in the list beginning
with `yava.

}

And some examples:

{ex

bhaga + mat > bhaga[vat]
(final `a)

lakSmI + mat > lakSmI[vat]
(penultimate `m)

}
