{h Parts of the system} 

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is a list of around 4000 rules of various kinds.
Together, we can use these rules to derive correct Sanskrit expressions.
Generally, any expression that we can derive through {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is
grammatically correct; and any that we cannot is grammatically invalid.

But the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} does not stand alone. It depends on several other
texts in order to work properly.

The first is the {dfn Shiva Sutras}, which we have seen already. These short
rules, which are not part of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} itself, let us precisely
and concisely describe different groups of Sanskrit sounds.

The second is the {dfn Dhātupāṭha}, a list of around 2000 verb roots. Starting
with the root {s bhU}, each of these roots is listed with its basic meanings
and with various {s it} sounds. Verbal derivation is one of the major
components of the Pāṇinian system, and this critical text defines the root
sounds we use when we begin a derivation:

{rule

bhUvAdayo dhAtavaH | 1.3.1
bhU-AdayaH dhAtavaH
`bhU, etc. [are called] `dhAtu (roots).

}

The third is the {dfn Ganapatha}, a list of various collections. The {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī} has various rules that refer to other lists of items:

{rule

sarvAdIni sarvanAmAni | 1.1.207
_
`sarva etc. [are called] `sarvanAman (pronoun).

}
