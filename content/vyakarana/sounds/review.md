{title Review}

In this unit, we built up the basics of the Pāṇinian system from scratch.
These fundamental rules and concepts apply to nearly every part of the {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī} and will serve as an invaluable foundation as we go forward.

Before we move on, let's take a moment to review what we've learned.

We learned about {s it} letters, which let us concisely add extra information
to terms in the grammar:

{rule

upadeze 'janunAsika it | 1.3.2
upadeze ac anunAsikaH it
In `upadeza, nasal vowels are [called] `it.

halantyam | 1.3.3
hal antyam
Final consonants [are called `it in `upadeza].

na vibhaktau tusmAH | 1.3.4
na vibhaktau tu-s-mAH
The `tu sounds, `s, and `m are not [called `it in `upadeza] when they are in a
`vibhakti (verb or nominal case ending).

AdirJiTuDavaH | 1.3.5
AdiH Ji-Tu-DavaH
Initial `Ji, `Tu, and `Du [are called `it in `upadeza].

SaH pratyayasya | 1.3.6
_
The [initial] `S of a `pratyaya (suffix) [is called `it in `upadeza].

cuTU | 1.3.7
cu-TU
The [initial] `cu sounds and `Tu sounds [of a `pratyaya are called `it in
`upadeza].

lazakvataddhite | 1.3.8
la-za-ku a-taddhite
The [initial] `l, `z, and the `ku sounds [of a `pratyaya are called `it in
`upadeza] when not in a `taddhita (nominal suffix).

tasya lopaH | 1.3.9
_
It [i.e. any `it letter] undergoes `lopa.

}

By using these {s it} sounds, we can then create {s pratyAhAra}s and define a
simple notation for describing {s savarNa} letters:

{rule

tulyAsyaprayatnaM savarNam | 1.1.9
tulya-Asya-prayatnam savarnam
[Sounds with] the same `Asya (place of articulation) and `prayatna
(articulatory effort) are called `savarNa (similar).

nAjjhalau | 1.1.10
na ac-halau
But vowels and consonants are not [`savarNa with each other].

svaM rUpaM zabdasyAzabdasaMjJA | 1.1.68
svam rUpam zabdasya a-zabda-saMjJA
A word [denotes] its own form if it is not a definition (`saMjJA).

aNudit savarNasya cApratyayaH | 1.1.69
aN-udit savarNasya ca a-pratyayaH
The `aN sounds and `udit [sounds] also [denote] their `savarNa [sounds], if
they are not `pratyaya (suffixes).

taparastatkAlasya | 1.1.70
ta-paraH tat-kAlasya
[A sound] bordered by `t [refers to the sound] with that duration.

}

We then created a variety of sandhi rules by applying these fundamental {s
paribhASA} rules:

{rule

SaSThI sthAneyogA | 1.1.49
SaSThI sthAne-yogA
The sixth case can signify `sthAne (in the place of).

sthAne 'ntaratamaH | 1.1.50
sthAne antaratamaH
In substitution, the closest [is preferred].

uraNraparaH | 1.1.51
uH aN ra-paraH
[In substitution,] an `aN vowel that replaces an `R is followed by `r.

tasminniti nirdiSTe pUrvasya | 1.1.66
tasmin iti nirdiSTe pUrvasya
When the seventh case is specified, [substitution is] of the previous.

tasmAdityuttarasya | 1.1.67
tasmAt iti uttarasya
When the fifth case [is specified, substitution is] of the next.

yathAsaMkhyamanudezaH samAnAm | 1.3.10
yathA-saMkhyam anudezaH samAnAm
Substitution of [items with] the same [size] is according to their relative
number.

}

We also learned about the basic types of rules: {s vidhi} (operation), {s
saMjJA} (definition), {s adhikAra} (government), {s paribhASA}
(interpretation), and a fifth type called {s atideza} (analogy) that we will
use later on.

Finally, we learned about the basics of a {s prakriyA} and how we should choose
which rules to apply during the derivation. We will learn much more about this
in the lessons to come.
