{title {s it} letters}

Before we talk about {s it} letters, let's first understand one of the problems
that Pāṇini was facing. Since we are not ancient grammarians, let's put the
problem in simple and concrete terms.

Suppose we run a clothing store that sells all kinds of shirts and saris. And
when our customers arrive, they want to find exactly what they're looking for.
How might we organize this store?

One obvious idea is to group similar items together: shirts with shirts, large
items with large items, and so on. Pāṇini uses a similar device to organize
lists of verb roots, lists of pronouns, and various other terms.

But one problem with this approach is that there is a limit to how much
information it can easily convey. For example, which shirts must be washed in
cold water? Which have been imported? Which are on sale? It can be difficult to
manage all of these different groupings.

One elegant solution is to add a paper {em tag} to each item we sell. This
small tag can tell us about the price, the country of origin, and whatever
other information we need to know. The tag is not part of the shirt; it's just
a label that tells us what the shirt is like.

Pāṇini probably didn't run a clothing store, but he certainly faced a similar
problem. He wanted to organize all of the terms in Sanskrit grammar so that
their roles and functions were clear. Most of these terms are grouped in large
lists, just as we might group shirts together in our store. But there are too
many important properties that need to be conveyed. Some of these properties
are:

{ul
    {li whether certain verbs are allowed specific suffixes}
    {li whether certain suffixes cause any unusual sound changes}
    {li whether certain terms have any unusual accents}
}

Just as we might add tags to items in our store, Pāṇini adds tags to the
different terms in the grammar. These tags are not part of the terms they
attach to; they're just labels that tell us what the term is like.

And since the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is part of an oral tradition, it's only
fitting that these tags are other sounds. The technical term for these sounds
is {s-dfn it}.

In eight rules, Pāṇini defines which sounds are {s it} and which are not.
These rules are so critical to the rest of the grammar that we will list all
eight of them here. If you know some Sanskrit, we recommend memorizing them.


{h Nasal vowels}

{rule

upadeze 'janunAsika it | 1.3.2
upadeze ac anunAsikaH it
In `upadeza, nasal vowels are [called] `it.

}

The term {s-dfn upadeza} ("instruction, teaching") here refers to the teaching
context of {s vyAkaraNa} and the Pāṇinian system. Specifically, it refers to
the technical language used within the system. So within this technical
context, nasal vowels are called {s it}.

With this rule, we can better understand the term {s udit} that was used in the
previous lesson. For example, we learned previously that {s ku} refers to the
five sounds {s ka}, {s kha}, {s ga}, {s gha}, and {s Ga}. More properly, this
is {s ku~} with a nasal {s u~} vowel.

By rule 1.3.2, {s ku~} is the consonant {s k} with the vowel {s u} as an {s
it}. By rule 1.1.70, the short vowel {s u} is called {s ut}. So, we can say
that {s k} is {s udit} ({s ut-it}, "having {s u} as an {s it}"). And since {s
k} is {s udit}, it is in scope for rule {a-cite 1.1.69}, which lets us
concisely refer to {s savarNa} (similar) sounds.


{h Final consonants}

{rule

halantyam | 1.3.3
hal antyam
Final consonants [are called `it in `upadeza].

}

With this rule, we can better understand the terms from the Shiva Sutras. In
the term {s ac}, for example, the final {s c} is an {s it} sound. Then we can
apply rule 1.1.71, which we haven't seen yet. First, we bring in rule 1.1.68
for context:

{rule

svaM rUpaM zabdasyAzabdasaMjJA | 1.1.68
svam rUpam zabdasya a-zabda-saMjJA
A word [denotes] its own form if it is not a definition (`saMjJA).

}

Then, we can define rule 1.1.71:

{rule

Adirantyena sahetA | 1.1.71
AdiH antyena saha itA
An initial [item denotes its own form and intermediates] up to the final `it.

}

Rule 1.1.71 defines the basic mechanism of the Shiva Sutras: an initial term is
paired with an {s it} and includes all of the terms between them:

{ex

a[N] > a i u

i[k] > i u R L

}

Terms that follow this mechanism are called {s-dfn pratyAhAra}s, and we will
see more of them in later lessons.

{h Minor rules}

For our current needs, the next five rules are minor, and we've left only minor
comments on them. Notice the context that carries over from one rule to the
next. The order of rules here is {em not} arbitrary; it is arranged to express
as much as possible in as little space as possible.

{rule

na vibhaktau tusmAH | 1.3.4
na vibhaktau tu-s-mAH
The `tu~ sounds, `s, and `m are not [called `it in `upadeza] when they are in a
`vibhakti (verb or nominal ending).

}

This rule applies to the inflectional endings that we use for verbs and
nominals. It will be useful later, but not right now.

{rule

AdirJiTuDavaH | 1.3.5
AdiH Ji-Tu-DavaH
Initial `Ji~, `Tu~, and `Du~ [are called `it in `upadeza].

}

These rules are mainly found on verb roots and usually allow specific suffixes.
The new word {s AdiH} ("initial") cancels the force of {s na} ("not") from rule
1.3.4.

{aside
{h Interpreting {s Tu~}}

Notice that {s Tu~} here literally refers to the sound {s Tu~}, not to the five
sounds {s Ta}, {s Tha}, {s Da}, {s Dha}, and {s Na} that we would get from rule
1.1.69. How do we know that {s Tu~} here doesn't refer to these five sounds?
Part of the reason is that if it did, then the {s Tu} in rule 1.3.7 below would
become pointless.

The sutra style is concise and compact; nothing is said carelessly. If we know
and remember this fact, then we can reason more clearly about what rules mean
and what they do.
}


{rule

SaH pratyayasya | 1.3.6
_
The [initial] `S of a `pratyaya (suffix) [is called `it in `upadeza].

}

Much of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} focuses on {s pratyaya}s and their properties.
We will explore the various {s pratyaya}s later on.

{rule

cuTU | 1.3.7
cu-TU
The [initial] `cu sounds and `Tu sounds [of a `pratyaya are called `it in
`upadeza].

}

{s cu~} refers to the five sounds {s ca}, {s cha}, {s ja}, {s jha}, and {s Ja},
and likewise for {s Tu~}. For the interpretation of {s Tu~}, see our note above
on rule 1.3.5.

{rule

lazakvataddhite | 1.3.8
la-za-ku~ a-taddhite
The [initial] `l, `z, and the `ku~ sounds [of a `pratyaya are called `it in
`upadeza] when not in a `taddhita (nominal suffix).

}

A {s taddhita} suffix is used to create nominal stems. We will revisit this
rule later.


{h {s lopa}}

Finally, we see what happens to these {s it} letters:

{rule

tasya lopaH | 1.3.9
_
That [i.e. any `it letter] undergoes `lopa.

}

And what is {s lopa}?

{rule

adarzanaM lopaH | 1.1.60
a-darzanam lopaH
Disappearance is [called] `lopa.

}

Rule 1.3.9 emphasizes a simple fact: these {s it} letters are just a helpful
notation. They are not "real" Sanskrit and have no meaning outside the
technical world of the Pāṇinian system. In our clothing store, a tag's role
is to tell us something about the clothes it is attached to; and in the world
of grammar, an {s it} letter's role is to tell us something about the terms
it is attached to.


{h Review}

With the rules above, we have cleaned up some of the loose ends that earlier
lessons left behind. We now have a complete and compact system for defining
different groups of Sanskrit sounds.

With this system in hand, we can now turn to the task of using it. In the next
lesson, we will see how this system can model sandhi changes clearly and
concisely. We will also learn about substitution rules, which are the last
major piece of the system's formal language.
