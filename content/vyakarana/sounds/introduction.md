{title Introduction}

Sanskrit words and sentences undergo many different kinds of {dfn sound
changes}. Vowels might combine or become consonants. Consonants might shift
from one class to another. And even more extensive transformations are
possible. Together, these sound changes are called {dfn sandhi}.

Many Sanskrit students learn a basic version of sandhi in the course of their
studies. But Pāṇini is not content with modeling the basics; his goal is to
model {em all} of Sanskrit's sandhi rules as fully as he can. And to do so, he
creates several devices that let him express these rules clearly and concisely.

In this section, we will learn about the specific techniques and devices that
Pāṇini uses to model Sanskrit's sounds and sandhi rules. Starting from scratch,
we will build up his core system step by step. And by the end, we will have a
simple but complete system that contains most of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}'s
essential components. Once we have that basic system in hand, we can explore
the rest of the grammar and see how the Pāṇinian system works in practice.


{h Sounds for beginners}

{note
The notes below provide a summary of the Sanskrit sound system. If you know
Sanskrit already, you can continue to the next lesson.

Most Sanskrit sounds are pronounced with five {dfn points of articulation}
within the mouth. You can see these five points marked in the image below:

{img[src=points_of_pronunciation.png]}

From right to left, these five points are:

{ul
    {li the {dfn soft palate}}
    {li the {dfn hard palate}}
    {li the {dfn alveolar ridge}}
    {li the base of the teeth}
    {li the lips}
}

All of the sounds below are colored according to which point of articulation
they use. Sounds that use multiple points of articulation, or that use
points of articulation other than the five above, are left black.

{note

The colors below are different from the ones used in the image. The image uses
red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. Respectively, we use red, orange, green,
blue, and purple below.

}

First are the {dfn vowels}. The first nine vowels are called {dfn simple
vowels}:

{sounds-dr a-1 A-1 i-2 I-2 u-5 U-5}
{sounds-dr R-3 RR-3 L-4}

And the others are called {dfn compound vowels} since they are made from
combinations of the simple vowels:

{sounds-dr e ai o au}

Of these vowels, five ({s a, i, u, R, L}) are called {dfn short}. The others
are called {dfn long} and are pronounced for twice the duration of the short
vowels. There is also a third length, {s-dfn pluta} (prolated), that is much
longer and much rarer.

All Sanskrit vowels can take one of three {dfn accents}: {s-dfn udAtta}
(high), {s-dfn anudAtta} (low), and {s-dfn svarita} (mixed). And they can be
either nasal or non-nasal. So each of the vowels above has 3 &times; 2 = 6
variants.

Next, we have the first twenty-five consonants.

{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1}
{sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}
{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3}
{sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}
{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5}

This is a grid with five rows and five columns. Each row in the grid uses a different
point of articulation, and each column encodes different properties:

{ul
  {li The first two columns ({s ka, kha}) are {dfn unvoiced} sounds, meaning
  that we pronounce them without using our vocal cords. (Compare "p" and "b" in
  English.) All the others are {dfn voiced}. Vowels are also voiced.}
  {li The second and fourth columns ({s kha, gha}) are {dfn aspirated} sounds,
  meaning that we pronounce them with an extra puff of air. All the others are
  {dfn unaspirated}.}
  {li The fifth column ({s Ga}) contains {dfn nasal} consonants, and the other
  columns contain {dfn stop} consonants.}
}

Next are the {dfn semivowels}, which have a close relationship to the vowel
sounds. All of them are voiced:

{sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5}

(Technically, {s va} uses two points of pronunciation. But this is a minor
detail, and it can essentially be treated as if pronounced only with the lips.)

Finally, we have the {dfn sibilants}. {s ha} is voiced, but the rest are
unvoiced:

{sounds-dr za-2 Sa-3 sa-4 ha-1}


{h Sandhi for beginners}

When sounds are pronounced continuously, they can change each other's
pronunciation. {em Sandhi} is the name for these sound changes.

Most sandhi changes are between two sounds that appear next to each other in
continuous speech. Here are some examples of common sandhi changes:

{ex

i + u > yu

a + i > e

k + a > ga

}

Some sandhi changes are optional and are applied at the speaker's preference.
Also, sandhi changes might be allowed or blocked in different environments,
such as:

{ul
    {li at the end of a word}
    {li at the end of a word that expresses the dual number}
    {li at the end of specific words}
    {li at the end of a verb prefix}
}

In other words, sandhi changes are not purely phonetic; we must also understand
{em what} is being said to apply them correctly.
