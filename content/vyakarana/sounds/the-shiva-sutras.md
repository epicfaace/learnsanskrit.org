{title The Shiva Sutras}

Many of Sanskrit's sandhi rules apply only to specific groups of sounds. Some
might apply only to simple vowels. Others might apply only to consonants that
are neither semivowels nor nasals. And still others apply to more specific
groups.

So as we begin to create our system, we must answer a vital and fundamental
question: {em How might we refer to different groups of sounds concisely?}

Let's enter the Pāṇinian system by seeing how it answers this question.


{h A list of sounds}

Suppose we visit a market that sells different kinds of fruits. Perhaps it
sells the following:

{ul
    {li mangoes}
    {li coconuts}
    {li jackfruit}
    {li oranges}
    {li apples}
    {li lychee fruits}
    {li papayas}
}

Suppose that we want to buy mangoes, coconuts, jackfruit, and oranges. One way
to ask for these would be to just name each fruit we want. That would be fine,
but it would take a long time to say. But if the sellers at the market know the
list above, we can just say "mangoes to oranges" to get the fruits we want.

Now suppose we want to buy just mangoes, jackfruit, and papayas. These items
are spread out far apart in our list. We can't say something like "mangoes to
papayas" because that includes too many fruits that we don't want.

What we learn from this is that the {em ordering} of fruits in our list is
important. If we order our list well, we ensure that common orders can be made
quickly. If we order it poorly, we create extra work for ourselves.

Pāṇini organizes the Sanskrit sounds in a similar way to this list of fruits.
By ordering the Sanskrit sounds carefully, he can easily and efficiently
make the groups he needs. And if we know how to use his list, we can use it to
concisely and precisely refer to different groups of Sanskrit sounds.

First, here is the list:

{ex

a i u [N]

R L [k]

e o [G]

ai au [c]

ha ya va ra [T]

la [N]

Ja ma Ga Na na [m]

jha bha [J]

gha Dha dha [S]

ja ba ga Da da [z]

kha pha cha Tha tha ca Ta ta [v]

ka pa [y]

za Sa sa [r]

ha [l]

}

Some say that this arrangement was inspired by the beat of Shiva's drum. So
these rules are often called the {dfn Shiva Sutras}. But how do the Shiva
Sutras actually work?


{h How the Shiva Sutras work}

Each rule in this list has two parts. The black letters are ordinary sounds.
And the red letters at the end of each rule are special letters called {s-dfn
it}s. These {s it} letters are not part of our list of sounds. Instead, they
just mark the end of each rule.

Suppose that we want to refer to all of the vowels. We start by choosing the
first item we want, which is {s a}. Then we choose one of the {s it} letters to
mark the end of our list. So we would choose {s c}, since {s c} follows the
last vowel in the list. The combination of these two is {s ac}. So that is the
name for all of the Sanskrit vowels: {dfn ac}.

Likewise, we can quickly refer to other groups of sounds:

{ex

a[l]
all letters

ha[l]
all consonants

jha[z]
all voiced stop consonants

jha[S]
all voiced aspirated stop consonants

kha[r]
all unvoiced sounds

}

But before we continue, perhaps you've noticed a few strange features of this
list:

{ul
    {li {em The vowels {s A}, {s I}, {s U}, and {s RR} are missing.} We will explain
    this in the next lesson. For now, just know that {s a} refers to both the
    short vowel {s a} and the long vowel {s A}. Likewise for the other vowels.}

    {li {em {s ha} appears twice.} The second {s ha} makes it easier to quickly
    refer to the four sibilant sounds ({s zal}). And when we use this list, any
    new name we create must include more than one sound. So {s hal} will always
    refer to all consonants, and never to just the sound {s ha}.}

    {li {em {s N} ends two different rules.} This is a real ambiguity, and we
    must rely on context and commentaries to make the usage clear. Perhaps
    Pāṇini ran out of {s it} letters and was forced to reuse one.}
}


{h Review}

Overall, the Shiva Sutras give us a clean and concise way to refer to different
groups of Sanskrit sounds. How well does it actually work for the rest of the
Pāṇinian system?
{a[href=https://user.phil.hhu.de/~petersen/paper/petersen_jolli_proof.pdf]
According to one mathematician}, this arrangement is mathematically optimal.

Even so, we still have some important open questions:

{ul 
    {li In the Shiva Sutras, why does the sound {s a} refer to both short {s a} and
    long {s A}?}
    {li What is an {s it} letter, really?}
}

The next two lessons will answer each of these questions in turn.
