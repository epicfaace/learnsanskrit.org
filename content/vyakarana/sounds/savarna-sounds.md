{title {s savarNa} sounds}

The previous lesson described how the Shiva Sutras let us refer to different
sound groups concisely. But we still have some important open questions:

{ul 
    {li In the Shiva Sutras, why does the sound {s a} refer to both short {s a} and
    long {s A}?}
    {li What is an {s it} letter, really?}
}

This lesson will answer the first question, and the next lesson will answer the
second question. As we answer these questions, we will also see some actual
rules from the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} and enter the system more deeply.


{h A new problem}

To start the discussion, here is a small sandhi change:

{ex

sItA azvam icchati > [sItAzvam] icchati
Sita wants a horse.

}

The vowels {s A} and {s a} combine to a single shared vowel {s A}. And there
are other combinations possible, too:

{ex

a + a > A

a + A > A

A + A > A

}

All four of these combinations are part of the same general idea: if any two
"a" vowels combine, the result is {s A}:

{ex

a/A + a/A > A

}

How can we refer to the category of "a" vowels concisely? More generally, some
sounds are {em similar} to each other in an important way. {em How can we
concisely refer to similar sounds?}


{h Our first rule}

To address the question above, we need several rules. Pāṇini starts by
introducing this rule:

{rule

tulyAsyaprayatnaM savarNam | 1.1.9
tulya-Asya-prayatnam savarnam
[Sounds with] the same `Asya (place of articulation) and `prayatna
(articulatory effort) are called `savarNa (similar).

}

This is the first rule we've seen from the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}, so let's dwell
on it for a moment:

{ul
    {li The numbers {em 1.1.9} mean that this is chapter 1, part 1, rule 9.
    The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} has eight chapters, and each chapter has four parts.
    You can click on these numbers to see the rule's traditional interpretation
    and commentary, as collected on {code ashtadhyayi.com}.}

    {li First, we show the original rule in Devanagari and Roman script.}

    {li Next, we show the rule with its sandhi changes removed and with its
    compound separated, so that it is easier to understand. To save space on
    your screen, we've written this version in just Roman script.}

    {li In the translation, the words in (parentheses) are short translations
    of the Sanskrit terms they follow.}

    {li In the translation, the words in [brackets] are not explicitly in the
    rule and must be provided from context. Context may come either from prior
    rules or from our prior knowledge of the system.}
}

Now, what does this rule actually mean?

{ul
    {li {s Asya} refers to one of the points of articulation in the mouth: the soft
    palate (where we pronounce {s ka}), the hard palate ({s ca}), the alveolar
    ridge ({s Ta}), the teeth ({s ta}), or the lips ({s pa}).}

    {li {s prayatna} refers to how these sounds are pronounced: with full
    contact between points of articulation (as with {s ka}), with partial
    contact ({s ya}), or with no contact ({s a}).}
}

So, sounds with the same {s Asya} and {s prayatna} are called {s-dfn savarNa},
which means "similar." This rule defines the term {s savarNa}, which can then
be used in the rest of the system. Rules that define a term are called {s-dfn
saMjJA} ("designation") rules.

However, this rule is too general. By 1.1.9, the sounds {s i} and {s z} could
be counted as {s savarNa} with each other. This definition will cause many
problems later. Has Pāṇini made a mistake?


{h Counteracting a rule}

Pāṇini has not make a mistake. In the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}, it is common for one
rule to state a general principle and for another to counteract it. To
counteract the overapplication of 1.1.9, we have rule 1.1.10:

{rule

nAjjhalau | 1.1.10
na ac-halau
But vowels and consonants are not [`savarNa with each other].

}

Notice thas the phrase "{s savarNa} with each other" is inferred from the
context of rule 1.1.9 above. This extension of context from one rule to another
is called {s-dfn anuvRtti}. There are specific principles that we can use to
define {s anuvRtti}. But for now, let's just focus on understanding this rule.

Rule 1.1.10 refers to {s ac} and {s hal}, which we learned about in the previous
lesson: {s ac} refers to all vowels, and {s hal} refers to all consonants.

With the extra context and these two definitions in mind, the meaning of the
rule is clear. Rule 1.1.10 prevents sounds like {s i} and {s za} from being {s
savarNa} with each other. Together, 1.1.9 and 1.1.10 give us a complete
definition of the term {s savarNa}.


{h Defining groups of sounds}

Now that we have a complete definition of {s savarNa}, we can return to our
original problem: {em how can we concisely refer to similar sounds}?

Pāṇini's solution is to provide these two rules:

{rule

svaM rUpaM zabdasyAzabdasaMjJA | 1.1.68
svam rUpam zabdasya a-zabda-saMjJA
A word [denotes] its own form if it is not a definition (`saMjJA).

aNudit savarNasya cApratyayaH | 1.1.69
aN-udit savarNasya ca a-pratyayaH
The `aN sounds and `udit [sounds] also [denote] their `savarNa [sounds], if
they are not `pratyaya (suffixes).

}

Rule 1.1.68 does not define a term or counteract a rule. Instead, it is an
instruction for {em us} as we read the grammar. Such rules are called {s-dfn
paribhASA} ("explanation") rules. {s paribhASA} rules usually apply throughout
the entire system, so it's important to understand them well.

What does rule 1.1.68 actually mean? We can make the rule clear with an
example. Suppose that we see some rule about the word {s agni}, which means
"fire." The point of rule 1.1.68 is that such a rule is about the specific form
{s agni}, and {em not} about any other word that means "fire."

Rule 1.1.69 then borrows this context to define another {s paribhASA}. (That
is, it inherits some context by {s anuvRtti} from rule 1.1.68). Rule 1.1.69
also uses two interesting terms:

{ul
    {li {s aN} has two interpretations, as we learned in the previous lesson.
    Here, it is the {s aN} that includes all vowels and semivowels.}
    {li {s udit} will be explained in the next lesson. For now, treat "{s udit}
    sounds" as meaning "sounds followed by {s u}."}
}

With these terms defined, we can see what 1.1.69 does for us:

{ul
    {li In the grammar, {s a} will refer to both itself and {s A}, which is {s
    savarNa} to it. Likewise for {s i}, {s u}, and so on.}

    {li In the grammar, {s ku~} will refer to both {s ka} and the four sounds
    {s kha}, {s ga}, {s gha}, and {s Ga}, all of which are {s savarNa} to {s
    ka}.  And likewise for {s cu~}, {s Tu~}, {s tu~}, and {s pu~}. ({s u~} is a
    nasal {s u}. Why is this vowel nasal? We'll explain in the next lesson.)}
}

So with these four rules, we can now refer to similar sounds simply and
concisely. But this system also creates a new problem. What if we want to
refer to short {s a} but not long {s A}? It seems that we can't do that
anymore. Has Pāṇini made a mistake?


{h Referring to short and long vowels}

Pāṇini has not made a mistake. We have one more rule to consider:

{rule

taparastatkAlasya | 1.1.70
ta-paraH tat-kAlasya
[A sound] bordered by `t [refers to the sound] with that duration.

}

Rule 1.1.70 follows right after rule 1.1.69, which we saw above. Note that it
continues to use context provided from 1.1.69.

What does this rule actually mean? It means that {s at} refers to the short
vowel {s a} but not to {s A}. Similarly, it means that {s At} refers to {s A}
but not to the short vowel {s a}. With this new rule, we can always tell these
vowels apart.

This rule also explains part of the term {s udit}, which we saw in 1.1.69
above. {s udit} is {s ut-it}: a term that has the vowel {s ut} (short {s u}) as
an {s it} letter. (But what is an {s it} letter, really? We will answer that
question soon.)


{h Different kinds of vowels}

As a closing thought, perhaps you are wondering if rule 1.1.70 is worth the
extra effort. Is this rule really necessary?

Yes. Sanskrit vowels make many important distinctions. They can differ in
length:

{rule

UkAlo 'jjhrasvadIrghaplutaH | 1.2.27
U-kAlaH ac hrasva-dIrgha-plutaH
The three lengths `u, `U, and `U3 [are called] `hrasva (short), `dIrgha (long),
and `pluta (prolated, overlong).

acazca | 1.2.28
acaH ca
And they occur in the context of vowels.

}

accent:

{rule

uccairudAttaH | 1.2.29
uccaiH udAttaH
[In the context of vowels], a high [tone is called] `udAtta (acute accent);

nIcairanudAttaH | 1.2.30
nIcaiH anudAttaH
a low [tone is called] `anudAtta (grave accent);

samAhAraH svaritaH | 1.2.31
_
and a mix [of the two is called] `svarita (circumflex),

tasyAdita udAttamardhahrasvam | 1.2.32
tasya AditaH udAttam ardha-hrasvam
of which the beginning is `udAtta for half the length of a short [vowel].

}

And nasality:

{rule

mukhanAsikAvacano 'nunAsikaH | 1.1.8
mukha-nAsikA-vacanaH anunAsikaH
An utterance [made with] the mouth and nose is called `anunAsika (nasal).

}

So in the context of grammar, {s a} refers to {em eighteen} variants (three
lengths &times; three accents &times two options for nasality). And even
{s at} refers to six variants (3 accents &times; 2 nasality options).


{h Review}

With the Shiva Sutras and the rules above, we now have a powerful framework for
referring to different Sanskrit sounds.

But there is still an important open question: what is an {s it} letter,
really? The next lesson answers this question and starts to explain the core of
the Pāṇinian system.
