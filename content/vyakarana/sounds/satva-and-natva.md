{title {s Satva} and {s Natva}}

In the previous lesson, we learned about various small changes involving the {s
anusvAra} and the {s visarga}. These changes also gave a clearer demonstration
of how rules in the {s asiddha} section work.

Here, we will take a quick look at two common changes that we will use
repeatedly throughout our series. These are:

{ul
    {li the change of {s s} to {s S}. This is commonly called {s-dfn Satva} ({s
    Sa}-ness).}
    {li the change of {s n} to {s N}. This is commonly called {s-dfn Natva} ({s
    Na}-ness).}
}

Both {s Satva} and {s Natva} have many exceptions and minor rules. So as
usual, we will focus on just the common patterns.


{h Change of {s s} to {s S}}

The consonant {s s} can become {s S} in several different circumstances. Here
we'll look at just one. To understand this rule, we must first consider four
rules that are either {s adhikAra} rules or rules that establish {s anuvRtti}:

{rule

apadAntasya mUrdhanyaH | 8.3.55
a-pada-antasya mUrdhanyaH
Of a non-word-final, &hellip; a retroflex.

saheH sADaH saH | 8.3.56
_
[The non-word-final] `s [of `sah in the form `sAD] becomes a retroflex [`Sa in
`saMhitA].

iNkoH | 8.3.57
iN-koH
After the letters `iN (`i, `u) or `ku~ (`k, `kh, `g, `gh, `G), &hellip;

numvisarjanIyazarvyavAye'pi | 8.3.58
nu~m-visarjanIya-zar-vyavAye api
Even if separated by `nu~m, the `visarjanIya, or `zar, &hellip;

}

Rule 8.3.59 is our focus:

{rule

AdezapratyayyaoH | 8.3.59
Adeza-pratyayayoH
[The non-word-final `s that follows `iN or `ku~ becomes a retroflex `Sa in
`samhitA] when it is of an `Adeza (substitution) or `pratyaya (suffix) [even
if separated by `nu~m, the `visarjanIya, or a `zar sound].

}

Rule 8.3.59 inherits different pieces from each of the four rules before it.
So in addition to teaching us a useful rule, rule 8.3.59 shows how much the
{cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} relies on the context of prior rules.


Now, what does rule 8.3.59 actually mean? For now, let's set aside certain
pieces of this rule. We will return to {s Adeza} in a future lesson, and
likewise for {s nu~m}. So, let's work with this simplified version of the rule:

{rule

AdezapratyayoH | 8.3.59
Adeza-pratyayoH
In `saMhitA, the non-final `s of a `pratyaya (suffix) becomes `S when it
follows `iN or `ku~, even if separated by the `vizarga or a `zar sound.

}

The interpretation of this rule is quite clear. We get changes like the
following:

{ex

agni + su > agniSu

guru + su > guruSu

vAk + su > vAkSu

}

Even if certain other sounds intervene:

{ex

haviH + su > haviHSu

}


{h Change of {s n} to {s N}}

Similarly, we have this change of {s n} to {s N}:

{rule

raSAbhyAM no NaH samAnapade | 8.4.1
ra-SAbhyAm naH NaH samAna-pade
When following `r or `S in the same `pada (word), `n becomes `N [in `saMhitA],

aTkupvAGnumvyavAye'pi | 8.4.2
aT-ku~-pu~-AG-nu~m-vyavAye api
even if they are separated by `aT sounds, `ku~ and `pu~ sounds, `AG, or `nu~m.

}

Rule 8.4.1 is straightforward. And rule 8.4.2 includes all kinds of sounds:

{ul
    {li the {s pratyAhAra aT} ({s a, A, i, I, u, U, R, RR, L, e, ai, o, au, h,
    y, v, r})}
    {li {s ku~} or {s pu~} ({s k, kh, g, gh, G, p, ph, b, bh, m});}
    {li the word {s A}, which is called {s AG} in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. {s A} is the
    prefix used in words like {s Agacchati}, but it has other uses as well.}
    {li {s nu~m} will be discussed in a later lesson.}
}

If rule {a-cite 8.3.59} shows the power of {s anuvRtti}, rule 8.4.2 shows the
power of Pāṇini's notation. Pāṇini describes a complex set of conditions in
just 8 syllables. And by applying these rules, we get changes like the
following: 

{ex

rAmena > rAmeNa
By Rama

pattrAni > pattrANi
The leaves

}


{h Review}

The other sandhi rules follow the same principles we've seen already. Studying
more sandhi rules might be interesting for its own sake, but it won't teach us
anything fundamental about the Pāṇinian system.

Therefore, now is a good time for us to review what we've learned and
consolidate our knowledge. Once we've done so, we'll be ready to explore the
rest of the Pāṇinian system.
