{title {s hal} sandhi}

{dfn {s hal} sandhi} is the general name for sandhi changes where the first
sound is a consonant. Here are some simple examples:

{ex

k + a > ga

S + ta > STa

}

Many of the rules of {s hal} sandhi appear after rule {a-cite 8.2.1}, so they
are {s asiddha} with respect to prior rules. In plain English, this means that
we must apply these rules in order.

{s hal} sandhi is much more extensive than {s ac} sandhi, and there is no
simple picture of it we can provide. Instead, we will focus on four kinds of
changes that we will see repeatedly throughout this series. These are:

{ul
    {li changes involving the {s anusvAra}}
    {li changes involving the {s visarga}}
    {li changes of {s s} to {s S}}
    {li changes of {s n} to {s N}} 
}

This lesson will focus on the first two.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

We have this new {s adhikAra}:

{rule

padaysa | 8.1.16
_
Of a `pada (word), &hellip;

}

The rules below also inherit the word {s saMhitAyAm} ("in {s saMhitA}") by {s
anuvRtti} from an earlier rule.


{h Changes involving the {s anusvAra}}

Generally, the {s anusvAra} is a sound that appears only due to sandhi. In the
{cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}, the sound {s m} and {s n} become the {s anusvAra} under
different conditions.

First is a general rule about {s m} at the end of a word. This rule inherits
the term {s hali} ("when a consonant follows") from the rule before it:

{rule

mo 'nusvAraH | 8.3.23
maH anusvAraH
`m becomes the `anusvAra [at the end of a `pada in `saMhitA when a consonant
follows].

}

By this rule, we get results like this:

{ex

nagaram gacchAmi > nagaraM gacchAmi
I go to the city.

}

We also have a second rule about {s m} and {s n} when they are not at the end
of a {s pada}:

{rule

nazcApadAntasya jhali | 8.3.24
naH ca a-pada-antasya jhali
[`m] and `n [become the `anusvAra in `saMhitA] if not at the end of a `pada,
when followed by a `jhal consonant.

}

By this rule, we get results like these:

{ex

mansyase > maMsyase
You will think.

ramsyase > raMsyase
You will delight.

}

But the {s anusvAra} itself might be changed by later rules. These rules appear
after the scope of 8.1.16 ({s padasya}) has ended:

{rule

anusvArasya yayi parasavarNaH | 8.4.58
anusvArasya yayi para-savarNaH
[In `saMhitA], the `anusvAra becomes `savarNa to the following [sound] when
followed by a `yay sound,

vA padAntasya | 8.4.59
vA pada-antasya
[but] optionally at the end of a pada.

}

{s yay} includes all consonants except for the sibilants ({s z, S, s, h}). So
the following changes are mandatory by rule 8.4.58:

{ex

aMkita > aGkita

ruMdhanti > rundhanti

}

And the following changes are optional, by rule 8.4.59:

{ex

nagaraM gacchAmi > nagaraM gacchAmi , nagaraG gacchAmi

aham pRcchAmi > ahaM pRcchAmi , aham pRcchAmi

}

There are two ideas worth noting here. First, 8.4.59 is the first rule we've
seen where we can choose whether to apply the rule or not. Many rules in the
{cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} are optional, though certain choices do tend to become
conventions over time.

Second, notice how the word {s rundhanti} is treated by these rules. Since we
must apply these rules in order, we have a derivation like this, where {s
rundhanti} is first changed by rule 8.3.23:

{ex

rundhanti > ruMdhanti

}

and then converted back to its original form by rule 8.4.58:

{ex

ruMdhanti > rundhanti

}

This kind of behavior is common in the {s asiddha} section.


{aside

{h A note on {s anusvAra} usage}

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is clear that rule 8.4.58 is mandatory. Printed texts,
however, will occasionally use the {s anusvAra} rather than laboriously write
out the correct nasal sound.

}


{h Rules that use the {s visarga}}

Like the {s anusvAra}, the {s visarga} is also a sound that appears only due to
sandhi. In the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}, the sounds {s s} and {s r} become the {s
visarga} under different conditions.

Let's focus on how {s s} changes, since those changes are more common. Our
first rule is still in the scope of 8.1.16 ({s padasya}) above:

{rule

sasajuSo ruH | 8.2.66
sa-sajuSoH ru~H
The `s [at the end of a `pada] and the [last letter of the word] `sajuS are
replaced with `ru~.

}

{s sajuS} is a rare word that we can set aside. {s-dfn ru~}, meanwhile, is a
temporary symbol that we will replace in later rules. For example, it might be
replaced by rule 8.3.15 below:

{rule

ro ri | 8.3.14
raH ri
The `r [at the end of a `pada] is replaced with `lopa when `r follows.

kharavasAnayorvisarjanIyam | 8.3.15
khar-avasAnayoH visarjanIyam
[The `r at the end of a `pada] is replaced with the `visarjanIya (`visarga)
when `khar or `avasAna follows.

}

Let's discuss both of these rules in more detail. Rule 8.3.14 accounts for
changes like the following:

{ex

dvAr rohitA > dvA rohitA
The door is red.

}

And the {s raH} of rule 8.3.14 also includes {s ru~}.

What are {s khar} and {s avasAna}? {s khar} is a {s pratyAhAra} that refers to
any unvoiced consonant. And {s avasAna} is defined in rule 1.4.110:

{rule

virAmo'vasAnam | 1.4.110
virAmaH avasAnam
Cessation [of speech] is called `avasAna.

}

So {s r} becomes the {s visarga} when at the end of an utterance or when
followed by an unvoiced consonant:

{ex

rAma s > rAma ru~ > rAmaH

rAmas khAdati > rAma ru~ khAdati > rAmaH khAdati
Rama eats.

}


{h Review}

In addition to describing some common changes, the rules above also give a
clearer idea of how rules in the {s asiddha} section work. In the next lesson,
we will finish our tour through sounds and sandhi by learning about two common
changes that occur within a single word.
