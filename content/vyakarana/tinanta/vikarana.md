{title {s vikaraNa}}

In the previous lesson, we continued our {s prakriyA} by replacing {s la~T}
with the ending {s ti}:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65
nI la~T | 3.2.123
nI tip | 1.3.78
nI ti | 1.3.3; 1.3.9

}

This {s ti} ending is called {s sArvadhAtuka} by {a-cite 3.4.113}. And a {s
sArvadhAtuka} ending can cause various kinds of changes to the term before it.

One common change is that a {s sArvadhAtuka} causes a new {s pratyaya} to be
added to the derivation. It is through these {s pratyaya}s that we get the
various {dfn classes} of Sanskrit verbs. In the examples below, you can see an
example of each verb class in the present tense:

{ex

bhU > bhavati

ad > atti

hu > juhoti

div > dIvyati

su > sunoti

tud > tudati

rudh > ruNaddhi

tan > tanoti

krI > krINAti

cur > corayati

}

These affixes are commonly called {s-dfn vikaraNa}s. In this lesson, we will
learn how to continue our {s prakriyA} by adding the appropriate {s vikaraNa}
after the root.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

The rules below are within the scope of these {s adhikAra} rules:

{rule

pratyayaH | 3.1.1
_
&hellip; is a `pratyaya (suffix).

parazca | 3.1.2
paraH ca
&hellip; and [it is inserted] after [the base].

}


{h The {s vikaraNa}s}

We start with the general case:

{rule

sArvadhAtuke yak | 3.1.67 
_
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `yak [is added after the `dhAtu] when a `sArvadhAtuka
[suffix] follows.

kartari zap | 3.1.68 
_
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `zap [is added] in `kartari-prayoga (agentive usage)
[after the `dhAtu when a `sArvadhAtuka suffix follows].

}

Rule 3.1.68 is a restriction on rule 3.1.67. We use {s zap} by default in {s
kartari prayoga}, and we use {s yak} in the other {s prayoga}s.

The rules that follow add further restrictions to the rules above. For example,
this rule defines the correct {s vikaraNa} for {s div} and some other roots:

{rule

divAdibhyaH zyan | 3.1.69 
div-AdibhyaH zyan
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `zyan [is added in `kartari-prayoga after the `dhAtu_s]
in the list beginning with `div [when a `sArvadhAtuka suffix follows].

}

How do we know which roots are in the {s div} list? Ultimately, we must consult
the {cite Dhātupāṭha}. When we do, we see that {s div} is the first rule of the
fourth major list ({s-dfn gaNa}):

{dhatu

divu~ krIDAvijigISAvyavahAradyutistutimodamadasvapnakAntigatiSu | 4.1
`div in the senses of: `krIDA (play), `vijigISA (desire to win), `vyavahAra
(transaction), `dyuti (glowing or shining), `stuti (praising), `moda (pleasing),
`mada (boasting), `svapna (sleeping), `kAnti (desiring), or `gati (motion)

}

So, all of the roots in the {s div} list will use the {s vikaraNa zyan} instead
of {s zap}.

Next we have the {s su} class:

{rule

svAdibhyaH znuH | 3.1.73 
su-AdibhyaH znuH
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `znu [is added in `kartari-prayoga after the `dhAtu_s]
in the list beginning with `su [when a `sArvadhAtuka suffix follows].

zruvaH zR ca | 3.1.74 
_
And [likewise] of `zru [which becomes `zR].

}

The {s tud} class:

{rule

tudAdibhyaH zaH | 3.1.77 
tud-AdibhyaH zaH
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `za [is added in `kartari-prayoga after the `dhAtu_s]
in the list beginning with `tud [when a `sArvadhAtuka suffix follows].

}

And the {s rudh} class:

{rule

rudhAdibhyaH znam | 3.1.78 
rudh-AdibhyaH znam
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `znam [is added in `kartari-prayoga after the `dhAtu_s]
in the list beginning with `rudh [when a `sArvadhAtuka suffix follows].

}

Note that the {s rudh} roots use the {s vikaraNa znam}. The actual suffix is {s
na}, which is {s zit} and {s mit}. By rule {a-cite 1.1.47}, {s na} will be
inserted after the last vowel of the root:

{ex

rudh > ru na dh

}

Next we have the {s tan} class:

{rule

tanAdikRJbhya uH | 3.1.79 
tan-Adi-kRJbhyaH uH
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `u [is added in `kartari-prayoga after the `dhAtu_s]
in the list beginning with `tan, and also after `kR, [when a `sArvadhAtuka
suffix follows].

}

And the {s krI} class:

{rule

kryAdibhyaH znA | 3.1.81 
krI-AdibhyaH znA
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `znA [is added in `kartari-prayoga after the `dhAtu_s]
in the list beginning with `krI [when a `sArvadhAtuka suffix follows].

}

{h The {s ad}, {s hu}, and {s cur} classes}

The other three classes use a slightly different approach.

The {s ad} class replaces {s zap} with {s-dfn luk}, which causes {s lopa}. In
the rule below, {s luk} is available through {s anuvRtti} from a previous rule:

{rule

adi-prabhRtibhyaH zapaH | 2.4.72 
adi-prabhRtibhyaH zapaH
[`luk] replaces `zap when it follows [the `dhAtu_s in the list] starting with
`ad.

}

The {s hu} class uses the suffix {s-dfn zlu}, which causes {s lopa} and also 
causes the root sound to be doubled ({s hu} &rarr; {s juhu}):

{rule

juhotyAdibhyaH zluH | 2.4.75 
juhoti-adibhyaH zluH
[The deletion suffix] `zlu replaces `zap when it follows [the `dhAtu_s in the
list] starting with `hu.

}

The {s cur} class, meanwhile, uses the suffix {s-dfn Nic}, which will come
before {s zap}. This is the same suffix used by causal verbs: 

{rule

satyApapAzarUpavINAtUlazlokasenAlomatvacavarmavarNacUrNacurAdibhyo Nic | 3.1.25 
satyApa~-pAza-rUpa-vINA-tUla-zloka-senA-loma-tvaca-varma-varNa-cUrNa-curAdibhyaH Nic
[The suffix] `Nic is added after `satyApa~, `pAza, `rUpa, `vINA, `tUla, `zloka,
`senA, `loma, `tvaca~, `varma, `varNa, `cUrNa, and [the `dhAtu_s in the list]
starting with `cur;

hetumati ca | 3.1.26
_
and likewise in the sense of causal action.

}


{h Review}

We can now continue our {s prakriyA} a few more steps:

{prakriya

NIJ | 1.3.1
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65
nI la~T | 3.2.123
nI l | 1.3.2; 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI tip | 3.4.78
nI ti | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI zap ti | 3.4.113; 3.1.68
nI a ti | 1.3.3; 1.3.8; 1.3.9; 3.4.113

}

(Note that {s zap} is called {s sArvadhAtuka} by rule 3.4.113 because it has {s
z} as an {s it}.)

Our verb is almost ready. In the next lesson, we will learn the last few rules
we need to complete the {s prakriyA} and get our finished verb.
