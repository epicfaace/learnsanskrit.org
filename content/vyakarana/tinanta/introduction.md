{title Introduction}

In the previous unit, we started from scratch and built up a basic version of
the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}'s core. We first learned about {s it} sounds, {s
pratyAhAra}s, and other devices that let us refer to sounds concisely. We
then applied that knowledge by defining various sandhi rules.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the Pāṇinian system, we can explore
the rest of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}. We'll start by exploring how the {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī} creates different words. Sanskrit words can be classified in many
different ways, but the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} uses a simple system:

{rule

suptiGantaM padam | 1.4.14
sup-tiG-antam padam
That which ends in `sup or `tiG [is called] a `pada (word).

}

{s-dfn sup} and {s-dfn tiG} are both {s pratyAhAra}s that refer to different
word endings. {s tiG} refers to the endings used for verbs. So in the
Pāṇinian system, verbs are called {s-dfn tiG-anta} ("ending in a {s tiG}
suffix").

In this unit, we will learn how the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} creates {s tiGanta}s. We
will also create complete {s prakriyA}s (derivations) for a variety of basic
verbs.


{h Basics of {s tiGanta-prakriyA}}

At a high level, here is what a {s tiGanta-prakriyA} is like. We start with the
specific semantics we wish to express. Perhaps we want the semantics of the
root {s bhU} in the present tense as applied to a single third-person entity.
Based on those semantic conditions, we can follow the rules of the grammar to
introduce specific terms:

{ex

bhU + la~T

}

Here, {s la~T} is an abstract suffix that usually expresses the present tense.
Based on our semantic conditions, we then replace with a specific ending:

{ex

bhU + ti

}

This suffix allows other operations to apply. For example, here we should
introduce a new affix {s a} between the root and the ending:

{ex

bhU + a + ti

}

Then we should apply the sound changes that are conditioned by the affix:

{ex

bho + a + ti

}

Finally, we apply normal sandhi changes and get a complete word:

{ex

bhavati
(He) becomes.

}

Of course, this isn't the full {s prakriyA} for the word {s bhavati}. There are
several small but important steps that we've left out. But in the lessons to
come, we will learn how to create a complete and correct {s prakriyA} for {s
bhavati} and for many other verbs.


{h Verbs for beginners}

{note
The notes below provide a summary of the Sanskrit verb system. If you know
Sanskrit already, you can continue to the next lesson.

{dfn Verbs} usually describe some kind of action, such as running, thinking, or
deciding. Sanskrit verbs express many different kinds of information at once,
and their underlying structure is complex.

Sanskrit verbs start with a basic {dfn verb root}. Here are some example verb
roots:

{ex

nI
lead

kR
do, make

}

By adding prefixes and suffixes to this root, we create different verbs forms.
Here are some examples:

{ex

neSyati
(Someone) leads.

kuryAm
I might do.

}

Sanskrit verbs are highly expressive. They can express three different {dfn
persons} (third person, second person, first person), three different {dfn
numbers} (singular, dual, plural), and ten different {dfn tense-mood}
combinations.

Sanskrit verbs also express something called {s-dfn prayoga}, which loosely
corresponds to the active/passive voice distinction in English. We have {s-dfn
kartari prayoga} ("agent usage," similar to the active voice), {s-dfn karmaNi
prayoga} ("object usage", similar to the passive voice), and {s-dfn bhAve
prayoga} ("stative usage", used only by intransitive verbs).

For a given {s prayoga}, we have 3 persons &times; 3 numbers &times; 10
tense-moods = 90 standard forms. But in addition, we can use certain verb
suffixes to create create derived roots:

{ex

nI > ninISa
lead > want to lead

kR > kAri
do > make do

}

And these derived roots can themselves be used in different persons, numbers,
tenses, and {s prayoga}s:

{ex

ninISa > ninISasi
want to lead > you want to lead

kAri > kArayeyuH
make do > they might make (someone) do

}
