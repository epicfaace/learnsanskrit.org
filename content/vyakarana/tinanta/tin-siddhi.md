{title {s tiG-siddhi}}

In the previous lesson, we noticed a small problem with one of our {s
prakriyA}s. When using an {s Atmanepada} suffix, what we expect is {s te}, but
what we actually receive is {s ta}. This ending will give us the incorrect *{s
nayata} instead of the correct {s nayate}. {comm *}

How do we ensure that our ending is correct?  The answer is a set of rules near
the end of {s adhyAya} 3 of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}. These rules transform the
basic endings in the {s tiG pratyAhAra} to suit the specific semantics we wish
to express. We can call the process of applying these rules {s-dfn tiG-siddhi}
("{s tiG} completion").

As you read the rules below, keep this critical {s paribhASA} in mind:

{rule

sthAnivadAdezo 'nalvidhau | 1.1.56
sthAnivat AdezaH an-al-vidhau
An `Adeza (replacement) is [treated] like its `sthAnin (replaced term) [in
terms of the properties it inherits, etc.], excluding rules that concern a
single sound.

}

This is an {s-dfn atideza} ("analogy," "extension") rule. The idea is that even
if the suffix {s ta} replaces {s laT}, {s ta} should still be treated {em as
if} it were {s laT}.


{h Creating {s laT Atmanepada} suffixes}

Using rule {a-cite 1.1.56} above, we can transform the basic endings in the {s
tiG pratyAhAra} into the form we expect. First, we have this {s adhikAra},
which we saw earlier:

{rule

lasya | 3.4.77
_
`la is replaced by &hellip;

}

To convert our {s Atmanepada} suffixes to the right form, we need to first
define a new term:

{rule

aco'ntyAdi Ti | 1.1.64 
acaH antya-Adi Ti
From the last vowel onward [is called] `Ti.

}

Now we can use this term to create the changes we need:

{rule

Tita AtmanepadAnAM Tere | 3.4.79 
TitaH AtmanepadAnAm TeH e
For the `Atmanepada endings of a `la that is `Tit, `Ti is replaced by `e,

thAsasse | 3.4.80 
thAsaH se
[but] `thAs is replaced by `se.

}

Simply, rule 3.4.79 means that for each {s Tit} ending, we replace all letters
from the last vowel onward with {s e}. Rule 3.4.80 is an exception for the
ending {s thAs}.

{s la~T} is {s Tit} by rule {a-cite 1.3.3}. And even if {s laT} has been
replaced by {s ta}, rule 3.4.79 still applies due to rule {a-cite 1.1.56}.

By applying rules 3.4.79 and 3.4.80, we get the following results:

{ex

ta AtAm jha thAs AthAm dhvam iT vahi mahiG
(default endings)

> te Ate jhe se Athe dhve e vahe mahe
(after 3.4.79 and 3.4.80)

}

Rule 3.4.81 to 3.4.112 are all transformation rules similar to the ones above.
We don't have any plans to cover them, but if you are interested,
{url[r=site.contact] let us know} and we'll add them.


{h Some extra {s saMjJA}s}

At the end of this section, there are four rules that add some extra {s
saMjJA}s to our endings:

{rule

tiGzitsArvadhAtukam | 3.4.113 
tiG-zit sArvadhAtukam
`tiG suffixes and `zit (with `z as an `it) `kRt suffixes are called
`sArvadhAtuka.

ArdhadhAtukaM zeSaH | 3.4.114 
ArdhadhAtukam zeSaH
All others are called `ArdhadhAtuka.

liT ca | 3.4.115 
_
And `liT [is also called `ArdhadhAtuka],

liGAziSi | 3.4.116 
liG AziSi
[as well as] `liG in the sense of `AzIH (benediction).

}

Like {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada}, {s sArvadhAtuka} and {s ArdhadhAtuka}
refer to complex concepts that are hard to summarize concisely. So let's pause
our discussion here and continue in the next lesson.


{h Review}

The rules in this section of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} transform our basic set of
verb endings into the precise endings we need for our specific {s lakAra}.

In the next lesson, we will examine what the term {s sArvadhAtuka} means and
what implications it has for our {s prakriyA}.
