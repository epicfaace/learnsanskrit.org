{title {s tiG-pratyAhAra}}

In the previous lesson, we learned about the abstract verb endings called {s
lakAra}s. If we use the {s laT-lakAra}, which usually implies action in the
present tense, we can extend our example {s prakriyA} one more step:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65
nI la~T | 3.2.123

}

Since {s la~T} is an {s upadeza}, we can apply rules {a-cite 1.3.2} and {a-cite
1.3.3} to remove its {s it} sounds:

{prakriya

nI l | 1.3.2; 1.3.3; 1.3.9

}

We could also remove {s l} by {a-cite 1.3.8}, but this will make it difficult
to use rule 3.4.77 later:

{rule

lasya | 3.4.77
_
`la is replaced by &hellip;

}

So we keep this {s l} and don't apply rule 1.3.8.

{aside 

{h Avoiding rule 1.3.8}

Why can't we apply {a-cite 1.3.8} and remove {s l}?

If we do, we will no longer be able to use rule 3.4.77 above. Rule 3.4.77 would
thus become a useless rule, and we would not be able to derive any verbs. So
we should avoid deleting {s l}.

This is part of an important principle when using the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}: if a
certain approach to {s prakriyA} would make a rule useless, that approach is
invalid. Every rule in the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is present for a reason.

{h {s tiG-pratyAhAra}}

{rule

lasya | 3.4.77
_
`la is replaced by &hellip;

tiptasjhisipthasthamipvasmas-tAtAMjhathAsAthAMdhvamiDvahimahiG | 3.4.78
tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mip-vas-mas-ta-AtAm-jha-thAs-AthAm-dhvam-iD-vahi-mahiG
[the `pratyaya_s] `tip, `thas, `jhi, `sip, `thas, `tha, `mip, `vas, `mas, `ta,
`AtAm, `jha, `thAs, `AthAm, `dhvam, `iT, `vahi, and `mahiG.

}

The {s G} at the end of {s mahiG} is present just so we can make a {s
pratyAhAra}. If we take the first term and use {s G}, we have {s-dfn tiG}, the
set of all verb endings in Sanskrit.

We can also make some minor observations about these {s tiG} suffixes:

{ul
    {li Many of these endings are marked with various {s it} sounds. {s G} lets
    us create the {s pratyAhAra}. {s p} causes vowel changes for certain kinds
    of verb stems. And the {s T} on {s iT} is so that we can more easily refer
    to this specific ending later.}

    {li We also notice the strange endings {s jhi} and {s jha}. {s jh} has a
    special role that we will discuss two lessons from now. For the time being,
    rest assured that these will become the more regular endings {s nti} and {s
    nta}.}
}

More importantly, however, notice that there are eighteen endings to choose
from. It is not obvious which one we should choose for our verb. How do we
choose the correct one?

We do so by adding different {s saMjJA}s (designations) to these suffixes. Each
of these {s saMjJA}s implies different semantics. Based on the semantics we
wish to express, we can then choose the correct suffix.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

These {s saMjJA}s are defined under the following {s adhikAra}:

{rule

A kaDArAdekA saMjJA | 1.4.1
A kaDArAt ekA saMjJA
Up to the `kaDAra rule (rule 2.2.38), one `saMjJA [is allowed].

}

And the following {s paribhASA}:

{rule

vipratiSedhe paraM kAryam | 1.4.2
vipratiSedhe param kAryam
In matters of conflict, the later [rule] should be applied.

}

The idea of the first rule is that if one {s saMjJA} is a subset of another,
only one of these two {s saMjJA}s applies. We will see a concrete example of
this further below.


{h {s puruSa} and {s vacana}}

First, we have distinctions of {s-dfn puruSa} (person) and {s-dfn vacana}
(number):

{rule

tiGastrINi trINi prathamamadhyamottamAH | 1.4.101
tiGaH trINi trINi prathama-madhyama-uttamAH
Taken three by three, the `tiG [suffixes] are called `prathama (first),
`madhyama (middle), and `uttama (last).

tAnyekavacanadvivacanabahuvacanAnyekazaH | 1.4.102
tAni ekavacana-dvivacana-bahuvacanAni ekazaH
They [i.e. these triples] are called `ekavacana (singular), `dvivacana (dual),
and `bahuvacana (plural) when taken one by one.

supaH | 1.4.103
_
[`ekavacana, `dvicana, and `bahuvacana also apply for the triples] of `sup
(i.e. the nominal endings).

vibhaktizca | 1.4.104
vibhaktiH ca
And [these triples are each called] `vibhakti.

}

Before we move on, note that rule 1.4.104 is vital. Normally, we would remove
the final {s s} and {s m} sounds of all of the {s tiG} suffixes by rule {a-cite
1.3.3}. But if these endings are called {s vibhakti}, then rule {a-cite 1.3.4}
blocks rule 1.3.3 and leaves our endings intact.

Now: what are the semantics of {s prathama}, {s madhyama}, and {s uttama}? They
are defined in next few rules:

{rule

yuSmadyupapade samAnAdhikaraNe sthAninyapi madhyamaH | 1.4.105
yuSmadi upapade samAna-adhikaraNe sthAnini api madhyamaH
When `yuSmad (you) is coreferent with the verb, even if implicitly so, `madhyama [is
used].

asmadyuttamaH | 1.4.107
asmadi uttamaH
When `asmad (I, we) [is coreferent with the verb, even if implicitly so,]
`uttama [is used].

zeSe prathamaH | 1.4.108
_
Otherwise, `prathama [is used].

}

And what are the semantics of {s vacana}? These two rules define them:

{rule

bahuSu bahuvacanam | 1.4.21
bahuSu bahu-vacanam
In the sense of many, `bahuvacana [is used].

dvyekayordvivacanaikavacane | 1.4.22
dvi-ekayoH dvivacana-ekavacane
In the sense of two or one, `dvivacana and `ekavacana [are used, respectively].

}

By choosing a {s puruSa}, we narrow down eighteen endings to six. By choosing a
{s vacana}, we narrow down six endings to two. That leaves us with one last
distinction to make:


{h {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada}}

{rule

laH parasmaipadam | 1.4.99
_
[The replacements for] `laH are called `parasmaipada.

taGAnAvAtmanepadam | 1.4.100
taG-Anau Atmanepadam
The `taG suffixes and `Ana are called `Atmanepada.

}

{s taG} is a {s pratyAhAra} formed with the tenth {s tiG} suffix {s ta}. By
{a-cite 1.4.1} and {a-cite 1.4.2}, the first nine {s tiG} suffixes are called
{s parasmaipada} and the rest are called {s Atmanepada}.

The terms {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada} refer to a concept that is more
complicated than {s puruSa} or {s vacana}. Since it's hard to convey in a
concise way, let's continue our discussion in the next lesson.


{h Review}

In the next lesson, we will discuss {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada}
properly and finally choose an ending for our verb.
