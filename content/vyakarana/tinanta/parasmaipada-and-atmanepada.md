{title {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada}}

There are eighteen {s tiG} suffixes in total. By choosing a particular person
({s prathama}, {s madhyama}, or {s uttama}), we reduce eighteen to six. And by
choosing a particular number ({s ekavacana}, {s dvivacana}, or {s bahuvacana}),
we reduce six to two.

To finally choose an ending, there is one last distinction we should make:
whether to use a {s parasmaipada} ending or an {s Atmanepada} ending.

There are two important questions we should answer here:

{ol
    {li What does it mean for an ending to be {s parasmaipada} or {s
    Atmanepada}?}
    {li How do we decide which of these types to use?}
}

The first question has a complex answer. {s-dfn parasmai-pada} literally means
"word for another," and {s-dfn Atmane-pada} literally means "word for oneself."
So a naive guess is that {s parasmaipada} endings are used for general actions
and {s Atmanepada} endings are used for self-interested actions.

But although this may have been true at one point in time, it is only half-true
in the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}. While some verbs do express the idea of
self-interested action, many verbs use {s Atmanepada} endings with no special
semantics at all. And in later Sanskrit, the distinction is almost entirely
absent.

The second question is a little easier. To decide which ending to use, we can
refer to a specific section of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}, which starts at rule
1.3.12. Based on those rules and the semantics we want to express, here are the
outcomes we might have:


{h Outcome 1: only {s Atmanepada}}

{rule

anudAttaGita Atmanepadam | 1.3.12 
anudAtta-GitaH Atmanepadam
`Atmanepada is used [after a `dhAtu that is] either `anudAttet (i.e. having
`anudAtta on an `it vowel) or `Git.

}

{s anudAtta} is one of the three vowel accents, along with {s udAtta} and {s
svarita}. Here, it refers to the accent an {s it} vowel has in the {s upadeza}.
{s Git}, meanwhile, refers to roots with {s G} as an {s it}.

{aside

{h Accents in the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}}

Originally, the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} and its secondary texts were all accented.
They used {s udAtta}s, {s anudAtta}s, and {s svarita}s extensively to encode
different kinds of information. But we no longer have these texts in an
accented form.

Thankfully, the many commentaries on the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} clarify where the
original accents were placed. With the help of these commentaries, we still have
the information we need.

}

Note that rule 1.3.12 does not imply any special semantics; there is no sense
of "for oneself" being implied. But there are other conditions where we might
use {s Atmanepada} endings with a clearer semantic difference:

{rule

bhAvakarmaNoH | 1.3.13 
bhAva-karmaNoH
[`Atmanepada is used after a `dhAtu] in `bhAve [`prayoga] or `karmaNi [`prayoga].

kartari karmavyatihAre | 1.3.14 
kartari karma-vyatihAre
[`Atmanepada is used after a `dhAtu] in `kartari [`prayoga] in the sense of
mutual action,

na gatihiMsArthebhyaH | 1.3.15
na gati-hiMsA-arthebhyaH
but not [in the sense of mutual action] after [`dhAtu_s] that denote motion or
violence,

itaretarAnyonyopapadAcca | 1.3.16
itaretara-anyonya-upapadAt ca
nor when the words `itaretara (each other) or `anyonya (each other) are
`upapada_s (i.e. used with the verb).

}

Here are examples of rules 1.3.13 and 1.3.14:

{ex

tvayA supyate
You sleep. (`bhAve: "There is sleeping by you.")

kaTaH kriyate
The mat is being made.

vyatilunate
They cut each other.

}

After rule 1.3.16, the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} continues with a list of small
exceptions, usually for specific combinations of verbs and prefixes:

{rule

nervizaH | 1.3.17
neH vizaH
[`Atmanepada is used after `dhAtu] `viz with the prefix `ni [in `kartari
`prayoga].

}

Since these exceptions are quite minor, let's skip them and consider the second
outcome we could have:


{h Outcome 2: optional {s Atmanepada}}

A select number of roots can use {s Atmanepada} optionally. And when they do
so, they express extra semantics:

{rule

svaritaJitaH kartrabhiprAye kriyAphale | 1.3.72 
svarita-JitaH kartR-abhiprAye kriyA-phale
`Atmanepada is used [after a `dhAtu that is either] `svaritet (i.e. having
`svarita on an `it vowel) or `Jit when the fruit of the action serves the
intention of the `kartR (agent).

}

The distinction, in theory, is that if the agent performs the action for their
own benefit, we may optionally use {s Atmanepada} for certain roots. Here is
the classic example:

{ex

devadatta odanaM pacati.
Devadatta cooks rice (for others).

devadatta odanaM pacate.
Devadatta cooks rice (for himself).

}

This is why roots like {s NIJ} and {s DukRJ} are marked with {s J} as an {s
it}. Because they are {s Jit}, they can use {s Atmanepada} endings per rule
1.3.72.


Rule 1.3.72 is again followed by some minor exceptions. So let's skip them and
consider the third outcome we could have:


{h Outcome 3: Only {s parasmaipada}}

All other roots use {s parasmaipada} by default:

{rule

zeSAt kartari parasmaipadam | 1.3.78 
_
After any other [`dhAtu] in `kartari [`prayoga], `parasmaipada [is used].

}

For example, the first root in the {cite Dhātupāṭha} is {s bhU}. {s bhU} is
neither {s anudAtta} nor {s svarita}, and it has no {s it} sounds attached to
it. So by rule 1.3.78, it uses {s parasmaipada} endings.


{h Review}

By considering person and number, we narrow eighteen endings down to just two.
And by appling the procedure above, we can finally select the right ending.

For our example root {s NIJ}, we have two choices. We can either reject rule
1.3.72 and use a {s parasmaipada} ending by rule {a-cite 1.3.78}:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65
nI la~T | 3.2.123
nI tip | 1.3.78
nI ti | 1.3.3; 1.3.9

}

Or we can accept rule 1.3.72 and use an {s Atmanepada} ending:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65
nI la~T | 3.2.123
nI ta | 1.3.72

}

But if you know some Sanskrit, perhaps you've noticed a small problem. For the
{s Atmanepada} form, we should expect {s nayate}, but the {s prakriyA} above
looks like it will give us the incorrect {s *nayata} instead. How do we ensure
that our {s prakriyA} give us the correct result? In the next lesson, we will
learn about the rules that help us do so.
