{title {s lakAra}}

In the previous lesson, we learned about the {s dhAtu}s in the {cite
Dhātupāṭha} and how to convert their {s upadeza} forms into something more
usable. But to create a verb, a {s dhAtu} alone is not enough. We must also add
a suffix to express the semantics we have in mind.

The verb suffixes in the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} have names like {s laT}, {s liG},
and so on. And because all of these suffixes start with the sound {s l}, they
are called the {s-dfn la-kAra}s ("the letters {s la}").

The rules below describe some of the basic semantics associated with each {s
lakAra}. Most of these {s lakAra}s have special uses outside of the basic ones
here. But rather than getting lost in details right now, let's focus on the
bigger picture.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

All of the {s lakAra}s are defined under the following {s adhikAra} rules:

{rule

pratyayaH | 3.1.1
_
&hellip; is a `pratyaya (suffix).

parazca | 3.1.2
paraH ca
&hellip; and [it is inserted] after [the base].

dhAtoH | 3.1.91
_
After a `dhAtu &hellip;

kRdatiG | 3.1.93
kRt a-tiG
&hellip; is called `kRt (a kind of nominal suffix), excepting the `tiG
suffixes.

}

In other words, a {s lakAra} is a {s pratyaya} that is inserted after a {s
dhAtu}. And since a {s lakAra} will later be replaced by a {s tiG} suffix,
it will not be called {s kRt}. ({s kRt} is a suffix that combines with {s
dhAtu}s to make nominal stems.)

Since we have a {s dhAtu}, let's select the right {s lakAra} to use. Six of the
{s lakAra}s refer to specific tenses ({s-dfn kAla}), and four refer
to specific moods ({s-dfn artha}s).


{h The six {s kAla}s}

Generally, {s-dfn luG}, {s-dfn laG}, and {s-dfn liT} describe the past tense:

{rule

bhUte | 3.2.84
_
In `bhUta (the past tense), &hellip;

luG | 3.2.110
_
[The `pratyaya] `luG [is added after a `dhAtu in the sense of past action]

anadyatane laG | 3.2.111
_
[The `pratyaya] `laG [is added after a `dhAtu in the sense of past action] that
did not occur today.

parokSe liT | 3.2.115
_
[The `pratyaya] `liT [is added after a `dhAtu in the sense of past action] that
was unwitnessed.

}

{s-dfn laT} describes the present tense:

{rule

vartamAne laT | 3.2.123 
_
[The `pratyaya] `laT [is added after a `dhAtu] in the sense of present action.

}

And {s-dfn lRT} and {s-dfn luT} describe the future tense. Rule 3.3.13 here
inherits the word {s bhaviSyati} ("in the future") from a prior rule:

{rule

lRT zeSe ca | 3.3.13
_
[The `pratyaya] `lRt [is added after a `dhAtu in the sense of future action],
and in the other [minor senses described in previous rules].

anadyatane luT | 3.3.15
_
[The `pratyaya] `luT [is added after a `dhAtu in the sense of future action]
that will not occur today.

}

Here are examples of all six {s kAla}s, as well as their meanings within the
Pāṇinian system:

{ex

abhUt
He was. (`luG)

abhavat
He (before yesterday) was. (`laG)

babhUva
He (long ago) was. (`liT)

bhavati
He is or becomes. (`laT)

bhaviSyati
He will be. (`lRT)

bhavitA
He will (eventually) be. (`luT)

}


{h The four {s artha}s}

{s-dfn lRG} has the sense of "would" or "would have". Rule 3.3.139 below
has the word {s bhaviSyati} ("in the future") through {s anuvRtti}:

{rule

liGnimitte lRGkriyAtipattau  | 3.3.139
liG-nimitte lRG kriyA-atipattau
[The `pratyaya] `lRG [is added after a `dhAtu] in a cause-effect relationship
[`liG-nimitta] in the future [`bhaviSyati] when the action is not accomplished.

bhUte ca | 3.3.140
_
and [likewise] in the past.

}

This complex description is easier to understand with an example:

{ex

dakSiNena ced [AyAsyan] na zakaTaM [paryAbhaviSyat]
If he [would come] by the southern road, the cart [would not overturn].

}

{s-dfn liG} and {s-dfn loT} have several senses in common:

{rule

vidhinimantraNAmantraNAdhISTasaMpraznaprArthaneSu liG | 3.3.161
vidhi-nimantraNa-AmantraNa-adhISTa-saMprazna-prARthaneSu liG
[The `pratyaya] `liG [is added after a `dhAtu] in the sense of `vidhi
(injunction), `nimantraNa (pressing invitation), `AmantraNa (permission),
`adhISTa (respectful or ceremonial request), `samprazna (courteous
questioning), and `prArthanA (supplication),

loT ca  | 3.3.162
_
as is `loT.

}

This overlap has a counterpart in English. For example, depending on the
context, we might say either "Eat!" or "You should eat." The second
statement is softer than the first one, but it often expresss the same
semantics:

{ex

khAda
eat! (`loT)

khAdeH
You should (or could, or might) eat. (`liG)

}

{s liG} has many different senses, but here are two more worth knowing about:

{rule

zaki liGca | 3.3.172
zaki liG ca
[The `pratyaya_s] `liG and [some suffixes from an earlier rule are added after
a `dhAtu] in the sense of `zak (be able to).

AziSi liGloTau | 3.3.173
AziSi liG-loTau
[The `pratyaya_s] `liG and `loT [are added after a `dhAtu] in the sense of
`AzIH (blessing or benediction).

}

In the sense of {s AzIH}, {s liG} uses special forms. Usually, we say that
these forms use {s-dfn AzIr-liG} ("{s liG} in the sense of {s AzIH}") as
opposed to the regular {s-dfn vidhi-liG} ("{s liG} in the sense of {s vidhi}"):

{ex

bhavet
He might be. (`vidhi-liG)

bhUyAt
May you be. (`AzIr-liG)

}

Finally, we have {s leT}, which is used only in Vedic compositions. {s leT} has
a meaning similar to {s liG}:

{rule

liGarthe leT | 3.4.7
liG-arthe leT
[The `pratyaya] `leT [is added after a `dhAtu] in the sense of `liG.

}


{h Review}

By adding a {s lakAra} to the end of our {s dhAtu}, we continue the process of
deriving our verb:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65
nI la~T | 3.2.123

}

A {s lakAra} is abstract, and we need to convert it into a suffix we can
recognize and understand. In the next lesson, we will learn how to do so and
get one step closer to completing our {s prakriyA}.
