{title {s dhAtu}}

Our {s prakriyA} begins with a {s-dfn dhAtu} ("element," "verb root"). If we
think of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} as a factory that makes metal sculptures, then
{s dhAtu}s are like the ores and metals that enter the factory. We then apply
various procedures to convert the {s dhAtu} into the shape we desire.

Here is how {s dhAtu}s are defined:

{rule

bhUvAdayo dhAtavaH | 1.3.1
bhU-AdayaH dhAtavaH
The items `bhU, etc. [are called] `dhAtu.

}

The word {s bhUvAdayaH} refers to a list of items starting with {s bhU}. But
where do we find that list?


{h The {cite Dhātupāṭha}}

The {cite Dhātupāṭha} is one of the secondary texts that we use with the {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī}. It is a list of roughly 2000 different {s dhAtu}s, and it also
contains a small number of extra rules that describe these {s dhAtu}s.

Each {s dhAtu} is listed with its basic meaning:

{dhatu

bhU sattAyAm | 1.1
`bhU in the sense of existing

}

This is the first entry we've seen from the {cite Dhātupāṭha}, so let's dwell
on it for a moment. First is the {s dhAtu} ({s bhU}). Next is its meaning,
given as an abstract noun ({s sattA}) in the seventh case. The {code 1.1} means
that this is the first root of the first {s-dfn gaNa} ("collection") of the
text. There are ten {s gaNas} in all, and each corresponds to a different class
of Sanskrit verb.

You can click on the {code 1.1} to see this {s dhAtu}'s entry on {code
ashtadhyayi.com}. There, you can see many of the forms that derive from this {s
dhAtu}, and you can click on a form to view a computer-generated {s prakriyA}.

The {s dhAtu}s in the {cite Dhātupāṭha} are provided in their {s upadeza}
forms. {s bhU} above is also an {s upadeza}, and it looks quite simple. But
other {s upadeza}s might seem especially strange:

{dhatu

DukRJ karaNe | 8.10
`kR in the sense of doing

Saha~ marSaNe | 1.188
`sah in the sense of enduring

NIJ prApaNe | 1.1049
`nI in the sense of obtaining or leading

vadi~ abhivAdanastutyoH | 1.11
`vand in the sense of greeting or praising

}

An {s upadeza} may look strange, but it has a deliberate design and conveys
plenty of useful information. In the sections below, we will convert these {s
upadeza}s into their more recognizable forms. Along the way, we will learn more
about why these {s upadeza}s have the strange forms they do.


{h {s it} sounds}

Do you remember where we first saw the word {s upadeza}? It was a part of rule
{a-cite 1.3.2}, which defines which sounds are {s it} and which are not. By
applying the rules from this section, we can remove the {s it}s from the {s
dhAtu}s above and create more recognizable forms:

{prakriya

DukRJ
kR | 1.3.3; 1.3.5; 1.3.9

}

Although it is incomplete, this is our first look at a {s prakriyA}. When we
write a {s prakriyA}, the left side shows the result and the right side shows
which rules we applied to get that result. As usual, you can click on the
numbers for some rule to see some information about that rule on {code
ashtadhyayi.com}.

The root {s kR} has the {s it} sounds {s Du} and {s J}. In other words, we can
say that it is {s-dfn Dvit} ("having {s Du} as an {s it}") and {s-dfn Jit}.
{s Dvit} roots can use a special suffix that we will study in a later unit. And
{s Jit} roots have a special function that we will study in our lesson on {s
parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada} endings.

Not all {s it} letters have some special meaning. For example:

{prakriya

Saha~
Sah | 1.3.2; 1.3.9

}

If {s a~} were absent, then the last {s h} of {s Sah} would become an {s it}
sound by {a-cite 1.3.3}. So we use {s a~} to protect the root's last consonant
sound.

As for {s NIJ}, it is {s Jit} just like {s kR}:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9

}

and {s vadi~} is {s idit} ("having short {s i} as an {s it}"), which we will
discuss further below:

{prakriya

vadi~
vad | 1.3.2; 1.3.9

}

Even after applying these rules, the roots {s Sah}, {s NI}, and {s vad} still
seem strange. Let's apply some more rules to convert them to a more
recognizable form.


{h {s satva} and {s natva}}

We can handle {s Sah} and {s NI} by using these two rules:

{rule

dhAtvAdeH SaH saH | 6.1.64
dhAtu-AdeH SaH saH
The `S that begins a `dhAtu is replaced with `s;

No naH | 6.1.65
NaH naH
and likewise, `N with `n.

}

The replacement of {s S} with {s s} is sometimes called {s-dfn satva} ("{s
sa}-ness"), and likewise for {s-dfn natva}. We can cause {s satva} for {s
Sah}:

{prakriya

Saha~
Sah | 1.3.2; 1.3.9
sah | 6.1.64

}

and {s natva} for {s NI}:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65

}

But why were these roots stated in such a strange way in the first place? To
answer that question, let's return to a rule from the previous unit:

{rule

AdezapratyayoH | 8.3.59
Adeza-pratyayoH
[The non-word-final `s that follows `iN or `ku~ becomes a retroflex `Sa in
`samhitA] when it is of an `Adeza (substitution) or `pratyaya (suffix) [even
if separated by `nu~m, the `visarjanIya, or a `zar sound].

}

The {s Adeza} in this rule refers to the result of a rule like {a-cite 6.1.64}.
If the first {s s} of a {s dhAtu} was created by rule 6.1.64, then we can apply
rule 8.3.59 to make changes like this:

{ex

vi sah > viSah

}

But several roots don't make this kind of change, even though they
start with {s s}. In order to distinguish which roots are which, Pāṇini thought
of a clever way to concisely split the roots that start with {s s} into two
classes:

{ul
    {li If a {s dhAtu}'s first {s s} is able to become {s S}, replace the {s s}
    with {s S} in the {s upadeza}.}
    {li If a {s dhAtu}'s first {s s} is {em not} able to become {s S}, do
    nothing.}
}

With this split, some of these roots will be in scope for rule 8.3.59 and some
of these roots won't. A similar line of thought applies for the change from {s
N} to {s n}.


{h {s nu~m}}

Last but not least, here is how we handle {s idit} roots:

{rule

idito nuM dhAtoH | 7.1.58
it-itaH nu~m dhAtoH
Roots that are `idit take `nu~m as a substitute.

}

Once we apply {a-cite 1.3.2} and {a-cite 1.3.3}, all that we are left with is
{s n}. {s u~} has no special purpose, but {s m} does:

{rule

Adyantau Takitau | 1.1.46 
Adi-antau Ta-kitau
[Substitutes that are] `Tit or `kit are placed before and after [the
substitution], respectively.

midaco'ntyAt paraH | 1.1.47 
mit acaH antyAt paraH
[Substitutes that are] `mit are placed after [the substitution's] last vowel.

}

What does rule 1.1.47 mean? It means that when the grammar asks us to replace a
term with {s nu~m}, what we really do is insert an {s n} after the term's last
vowel.  You can see this insertion in the {s prakriyA} below. Note the use of
rules 8.3.24 and 8.4.58, which are from the {s asiddha} section of the {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī}:

{prakriya

vadi~
vad | 1.3.2; 1.3.9
va nu~m d | 7.1.58; 1.1.47
va n d | 1.3.2; 1.3.3; 1.3.9
va M d | 8.3.24
va n d | 8.4.58

}

Why do we use {s nu~m} at all? Ultimately, it is for reasons similar to why we
use {s S} and {s N} in our roots.


{h {s sanAdyanta-dhAtu}s}

On the subject of {s dhAtu}s, there is one more type of {s dhAtu} worth knowing
about:

{rule

sanAdyantA dhAtavaH | 3.1.32
san-Adi-antAH dhAtataH
Terms ending with [the suffixes] `san etc. are [also] called `dhAtu.

}

This rule refers to various suffixes listed from rules 3.1.5 to rules 3.1.31,
starting with the suffix {s san}.  {s san} is the suffix that creates verbs
like this:

{ex

nI + san > ninISa > ninISati
He wants to lead.

}

But perhaps the most common of these is the suffix {s Nic}, which often creates
causal roots:

{ex

nI + Nic > nAyi > nAyayati
He makes (someone) lead.

}

Once we add such suffixes, we can treat the result like any other root. That is
why these results are called {s dhAtu} as well.


{h Review}

In this lesson, we learned how to read roots in the {cite Dhātupāṭha} and
convert a root's raw {s upadeza} form into a form we can more easily recognize
and understand:

{prakriya

NIJ
NI | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
nI | 6.1.65

}

Now that we have our {s dhAtu}, it's time to start using it. In the next
lesson, we will begin the process of verb derivation by adding a verb suffix to
our root.
