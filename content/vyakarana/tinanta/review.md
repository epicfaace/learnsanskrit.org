{title Review}

In this unit, we applied our basic system to the task of deriving Sanskrit
verbs. We saw that the process has a few basic steps:

{ol
    {li Choose a {s dhAtu} from the {cite Dhātupāṭha}}
    {li Choose the right {s lakAra}}
    {li Determine whether the root uses {s parasmaipada} or {s Atmanepada}
    endings}
    {li Replace the {s lakAra} with the appropriate {s tiG} ending}
    {li Add a {s vikaraNa} as needed}
    {li Apply {s guNa} changes ar needed}
    {li Apply sandhi rules}
}

This unit focused on verbs created with {s laT-lakAra}, but all verbs will
follow this basic framework.


{h Index of rules}

Rules 1.3.12 to 1.3.93 specify the uses of {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada}.

Rules 3.4.77 to 3.4.117 specify {s tiG-siddhi}.
