{title Review}

In this unit, we applied our basic system to the task of deriving Sanskrit
verbs. We saw that the process has a few basic steps:

{ol
    {li Choose a {s dhAtu} from the {cite Dhātupāṭha}.}
    {li Choose the right {s lakAra}.}
    {li Determine whether the root uses {s parasmaipada} or {s Atmanepada}
    endings.}
    {li Replace the {s lakAra} with the appropriate {s tiG} ending.}
    {li Add a {s vikaraNa} as needed.}
    {li Apply {s guNa} changes as needed.}
    {li Apply sandhi rules.}
}

This unit focused on verbs created with {s laT-lakAra}, but all verbs will
follow this basic framework.


{h Index of rules}

{table
{tr {th Rules} {th Topic}}
{tr {td 1.3.12 - 1.3.93}
    {td Use of {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada}}}
{tr {td 3.1.5 - 3.1.32}
    {td Use of {s san-Adi} suffixes, which create derived {s dhAtu}s}}
{tr {td 3.4.77 - 3.4.117} {td {s tiG-siddhi}}}
}
