{title {s guNa}}

Now that our suffixes are in place, it is time to apply any rules that are
conditioned by these suffixes. For {s sArvadhAtuka} suffixes specifically,
there is one particular operation we should learn about: the replacement of the
root vowel with its {s guNa} form. Here is an example:

{ex

nI a te > ne a te

}

In this lesson, we will learn more about {s guNa} and some of the rules that
use it.


{h The first six rules}

The first six rules of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} are all about {s guNa} and {s
vRddhi}. The first two rules define the terms {s guNa} and {s vRddhi}, and the
next four then define how {s guNa} and {s vRddhi} interact with other terms:

{rule

vRddhirAdaic | 1.1.1
vRddhiH At-aic
The vowels `A, `ai, and `au are called `vRddhi.

adeGguNaH | 1.1.2
at-eG guNaH
The vowels `a, `e`, and `o are called `guNa.

iko guNavRddhI | 1.1.3
ikaH guNa-vRddhI
`guNa and `vRddhi replace the `ik vowels,

na dhAtulopa ArdhadhAtuke | 1.1.4 
na dhAtulope ArdhadhAtuke
but not when followed by an `ArdhadhAtuka that causes [partial] `lopa of the
`dhAtu,

kGiti ca | 1.1.5 
k-Giti ca
or when followed by [terms that are] `kit or `Git,

dIdhIvevITAm | 1.1.6 
dIdhI-vevI-iTAm
or when applied to [the roots] `dIdhI and `vevI, or [the augment] `iT.

}

Let's set some of these rules aside. We saw rules 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 in a previous
lesson, so we don't need to dwell on them further. And rules 1.1.4 and 1.1.6
are minor, so we can set them aside as well. That leaves us with rules 1.1.3
and 1.1.5.

Rule 1.1.3 defines the basic function of {s guNa} and {s vRddhi} vowels: they
replace the {s ik} vowels ({s i, u, R, L}). And rule 1.1.4 restricts this
substitution: the substitution is blocked if the following term is {s Git} or
{s kit}.

Which kinds of terms are {s kit} or {s Git}? As a small example, the common
suffix {s -ta} is stated as {s-dfn kta} in the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}. Because {s
kta} is {s kit}, it will not cause {s guNa} or {s vRddhi} changes.


{aside
{h Interpreting rule 1.1.5}

The traditional interpretation of rule 1.1.5 is that it refers not only to {s
kit} and {s Git} but also to {s git}, which is hidden by sandhi. This
interpretation is part of a series of small changes that fixes one of the
incorrect words that the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} would otherwise produce.

Here, we use the more straightforward interpretation. {s git} is a minor point,
and there are also strong arguments that Pāṇini did not intend to imply {s git}
here.

}


{h {s Gittva}}

There are also several suffixes that are treated {em as if} they are {s Git}
suffixes.  Those suffixes are defined in the following four {s atideza}
("analogy", "extension") rules. All of these rules are useful, but rule 1.2.4
is our focus here:

{rule

gAGkuTAdibhyo'JNinGit | 1.2.1 
gAG-kuT-AdibhyaH a-J-Nit Git
The following are `Git: [a term] after `gAG and the root list starting with
`kuT, if the term is not `Jit or `Nit;

vija iT | 1.2.2 
vijaH iT
the `iT after the [root] `vij;

vibhASorNoH | 1.2.3 
vibhASA URNoH
optionally, [the `iT after the root] `UrNu;

sArvadhAtukamapit | 1.2.4 
sArvadhAtukam a-pit
and `sArvadhAtuka [suffixes] that are not `pit.

}

More plainly: a {s sArvadhAtuka} affix that is not {s pit} will be treated as
{s Git}. And since it is treated as {s Git}, it will not be able to cause any
{s guNa} changes to the root sound.

Since {s zap} is {s pit}, rule 1.2.4 will not apply to it, and it will still be
able to cause {s guNa} changes.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

There is one relevant {s adhikAra} here:

{rule

aGgasya | 6.4.1
_
Of an `aGga, &hellip;

}

And what is an {s aGga}?

{rule

yasmAt pratyayavidhistadAdi pratyaye'Ggam | 1.4.13 
yasmAt pratyaya-vidhiH tat-Adi pratyaye aGgam
If a rule introduces a `pratyaya after some specific term, everything from that
term up to the `pratyaya [is called] an `anga.

}

So if a {s pratyaya} is introduced after a {s dhAtu}, that {s dhAtu} is called
{s aGga} with respect to the {s pratyaya}.


{h Replacement by {s guNa}}

Rule 7.3.84 contains the word {s guNa} by {s anuvRtti} from a previous rule:

{rule

sArvadhAtukArdhadhAtukayoH | 7.3.84 
sArvadhAtuka-ArdhadhAtukayoH
[An `aGga is replaced with `guNa] when followed by a `sArvadhAtuka or
`ArdhadhAtuka suffix.

}

But to properly understand this rule, we must refer to two other rules.
First, we know from rule {a-cite 1.1.3} that {s guNa} can replace only an
{s ik} vowel. But which {s ik} vowel do we replace? We can decide which vowel
to replace by referring to a new {s paribhASA}:

{rule

yena vidhistadantasya | 1.1.72
yena vidhiH tat-antasya
[A term] by which a rule [is specified refers to an item that] ends in that
[term].

}

In other words, the rule applies to the final sound of the {s aGga}. If we use
rules 1.1.3 and 1.1.72, we can properly understand rule 7.3.84:

{rule

sArvadhAtukArdhadhAtukayoH | 7.3.84 
sArvadhAtuka-ArdhadhAtukayoH
[An `aGga's last `ik vowel is replaced with `guNa] when followed by a
`sArvadhAtuka or `ArdhadhAtuka suffix.

}

Then we can continue with our {s prakriyA}:

{prakriya

nI a ti | 1.3.3; 1.3.8; 1.3.9
ne a ti | 7.3.84

}


{h {s laghu} and {s guru}}

There is another important instance where {s guNa} can apply. If we define the
terms {s laghu}:

{rule 

halo'nantarAH saMyogaH | 1.1.7 
halaH anantarAH saMyogaH
Consonants without an interval between them are called `saMyoga (conjunct).

hrasvaM laghu | 1.4.10 
hrasvam laghu
A `hrasva (short vowel) is called `laghu,

saMyoge guru | 1.4.11 
_
but it is called `guru when followed by `saMyoga.

dIrghaM ca | 1.4.12 
dIrgham ca
And `dIrgha is also [called `guru].

}

and {s upadhA}:

{rule

alo'ntyAt pUrva upadhA | 1.1.65 
alaH antyAt pUrvaH upadhA
The sound before the last sound is called `upadhA (penultimate).

}

Then we can understand rule 7.3.86, which follows rule {a-cite 7.3.84}:

{rule

pugantalaghUpadhasya ca | 7.3.86
pu~k-anta-laghu-upadhasya ca
And [the last `ik vowel of an `aGga] ending with `pu~k or whose `upadhA
(penultimate sound) is `laghu (a light syllable) [is replaced with `guNa].

}

Let's set aside {s pu~k}, since it is a minor point. Then the rule has a plain
meaning: if the penultimate sound of the {s aGga} is {s laghu}, then we can
replace that sound with its {s guNa}.

Together, rules 7.3.84 and 7.3.85 cause {s guNa} in a variety of roots:

{ex

nI + zap > ne a

bhU + zap > bho a

zuc + zap > zoc a

}

and leave others alone:

{ex

nind + zap > nind a
(`upadhA is not a vowel.)

jIv + zap > jIv a
(`upadhA is long.)

}


{h Review}

We now have all of the essential components we need to complete our {s
prakriyA}. In the next lesson, we will generate all eighteen forms of the root
{s nI} in the present tense ({s laT}) with {s kartari prayoga}.
