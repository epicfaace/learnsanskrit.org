{title {s bahuvrIhi}}

Generally, the {s-dfn bahuvrIhi} is a compound whose members describe a third
idea that is not explicitly stated:

{ex

bahuvrIhiH [(strI)]

}

The {s bahuvrIhi} is much less complicated than the {s tatpuruSa}, and we can
account for most of its behavior with just a few rules:

{rule

zeSaH bahuvrIhiH
The remaining `samAsa_s are called `bahuvrIhi.

anekamanyapadArthe | 2.2.24 
anekam anya-pada-arthe
Many related (`pada_s) denoting a separate `pada [optionally become a
`bahuvrIhi].

tena saheta tulyayoge | 2.2.28
tena saha iti tulya-yoge
The word `saha [with a `subanta] that has the same relation to the action (as
the word it describes) [optionally becomes a `bahuvrIhi].

}

Examples:

{ex

mahAn ratho yasya > mahArathaH
whose chariot is great (2.2.24)

saputraH (AgataH)
(came) with his son (2.2.28)

}
