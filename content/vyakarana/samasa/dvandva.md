{title {s dvandva}}

The {s dvandva} is just a collection of words that would otherwise be connected
with the word {s ca} ("and"):

{ex

rAmo lakSmaNaz [ca] > rAmalakSmaNau
Rama [and] Lakshmana

}

With the following two rules as context:

{rule

vibhASA | 2.1.11
vibhASA
Optionally, ...

anekamanyapadArthe | 2.2.24
anekam anya-pada-arthe
Many related (`pada_s) denoting a separate `pada [optionally become a
`bahuvrIhi].

}

We can define a {s dvandva} quite simply:

{rule

cArthe dvandvaH | 2.2.29
ca-arthe dvandvaH
[Many related `pada_s] (connected) in the sense of "and" [optionally become a
`dvandva].

}
