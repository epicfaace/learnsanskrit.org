{title {s tatpuruSa}}

The {s-dfn tatpuruSa} is a versatile compound whose first member desribes its
second:

{ex

rAjJaH putraH > rAjaputraH
the king's son; a prince

}


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

Most of the system's {s samAsa} rules are specifically about the {s tatpuruSa}.
These rules are within the scope of the following two {s adhikAra} rules:

{rule

vibhASA | 2.1.11
vibhASA
Optionally, ...

tatpuruSaH | 2.1.22
tatpuruSaH
... is a `tatpuruSa.

}

The first rule states that the {s tatpuruSa} is optional. For example, both {s
rAjJaH putraH} and {s rAjaputraH} express the same semantics. In comparison,
the {s avyayIbhAva} is an obligatory ({s nitya}) compound; we cannot break the
compound into separate words while keeping the same semantics.

The second rule, meanwhile, just states that the following rules define a {s
tatpuruSa}.


{h The {s tatpuruSa} with different {s vibhakti}s}

Generally, the first word of the {s tatpuruSa} can appear in any {s vibhakti}
in relation to the second. But some of these {s vibhakti}s are more restricted
than others:

{rule

dvitIyA zritAtItapatitagatAtyastaprAptApannaiH | 2.1.24
dvitIyA zrita-atIta-patita-gata-atyasta-prApta-ApannaiH
[A `subanta ending in] the second (`vibhakti used with the words) `zrita,
`atIta, `patita, `gata, `atyasta, `prApta, `Apanna [optionally creates a
`tatpuruSa].

}

In comparison, the first and sixth {s vibhakti}s are less restricted. The sixth
{s vibhakti} has no restriction at all:

{rule

SaSThI | 2.2.8
SaSThI
[A `subanta ending in] the sixth (`vibhakti) [optionally creates a `tatpuruSa].

}

And the first {s vibhakti} is acceptable whenever the first word qualifies the
second in some way:

{rule

vizeSaNam vizeSyeNa bahulam | 2.1.57
vizeSaNam vizeSyeNa bahulam
An adjective with its qualified term variously [forms a `tatpuruSa].

}
