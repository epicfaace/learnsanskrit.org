{h Defining the {s avyayIbhAva}}

We first introduce another {s adhikAra}:

{rule

avyayIbhAvaH | 2.1.5
avyayIbhAvaH
... is an `avyayIbhAva.

}

Then the definition begins. First, the general case:

{rule

avyayaM vibhaktisamIpasamRddhyvyRddhy-arthAbhAvAtyayAsamprati-zabdaprAdurbhAvapazcAd-yathAnupUrvyayaugapadya-sAdRzyasampattisAkalyAntavacaneSu | 2.1.6
avyayam vibhakti-samIpa-samRddhi-vyRddhi-arthAbhAva-atyaya-asamprati-zabdaprAdurbhAva-pazcAt-yathA-anupUrvya-yaugapadya-sAdRzya-sampatti-sAkalya-antavacaneSu
An `avyaya [used with a related `subanta becomes an `avyayIbhAva `samAsa] when
the `avyaya has the sense of: a `vibhakti, nearness, prosperity, loss, absence,
expiry, non-presence, appearance of a word, later, accordance, sequence,
simultaneity, similarity, entirety, or limit.

}

Rule 2.1.6 is massive and allows examples like {s upakumbham} ("near the pot"),
{s nirmakSikam} ("without flies"), and {s satRNam} ("along with the grass").
The other rules for an {s avyayIbhAva} are more straightforward:

{rule

yathAsAdRzye | 2.1.7
yathA a-sAdRzye
`yathA when not in the sense of `sAdRzya (similarity) [becomes an `avyayIbhAva
`samAsa when used with a related `subanta].

yAvadavadhAraNe | 2.1.8
yAvat avadhAraNe
Likewise for `yAvat in the sense of equal quantity;

suppratiNA mAtrArthe | 2.1.9
sup pratiNA mAtra-arthe
`prati as the second member when in the sense of "a small amount";

akSazalAkAsaMkhyAH pariNA | 2.1.10
akSa-zalAkA-saMkhyAH pariNA
and the words `akSa (dice), `zalAkA (stick), and numerals with the word `pari.

}
