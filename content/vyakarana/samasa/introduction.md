{title Introduction}

In this unit, we will extend the knowledge we've built up and focus on {s-dfn
samAsa}s (compounds). Most of the rules for {s samAsa}s are in sections 2.1 and
2.2 of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}.

The {s samAsa} is one of Sanskrit's most notable features. Simple {s samAsa}s
generally have just two words. But {s samAsa}s can themselves be combined to
make longer {s samAsa}s, so there is no hard limit on how long they can be.

Since we have a basic understanding of {s subanta}s, we can understand the {s
samAsa}'s core principles fairly easily. Generally, the idea is that if two {s
subanta}s have some kind of semantic relationship:

{ex

gajasya vanam
the elephant's forest

}

then we can remove the {s sup-pratyaya} from the first {s subanta} and combine
the two into a single word:

{ex

gajasya vanam > [gajavanam]
the elephant's forest > [gajavanam]

}

But there are two subtleties here. First, not all semantic relationships are
allowed to be expressed as {s samAsa}s. Second, some semantic relationships
exist {em only} as {s samAsa}s and cannot be expressed any other way. So in the
lessons to come, we will learn how the system defines which are which.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

All {s samAsa}s are defined under the following two {s adhikAra} rules:

{rule

prAkkaDArAtsamAsaH | 2.1.3
prAk kaDArAt samAsaH
Up to the rule containing `kaDAra (2.2.38), the `samAsa &hellip;

saha supA | 2.1.4
saha supA
[A `samAsa] is [of a `sup] with (another) `sup.

}

Rule 2.1.4 inherits the term {s sup} by {s anuvRtti} from rule 2.1.2, which is
unrelated to {s samAsa}s. Together, rules 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 define a {s samAsa}
as a combination of two {s subanta}s.


{h Word ordering in a {s samAsa}}

How do we ensure that we order the words in a {s samAsa} correctly? Simple, we
use the following two rules:

{rule

prathamAnirdiSTaM samAsa upasarjanam | 1.2.43
prathamA-nirdiSTam samAse upasarjanam
In (the context of) a `samAsa, the (term) stated in the first (`vibhakti) is
called `upasarjana.

upasarjanaM pUrvam | 2.2.30
upasarjanam pUrvam
[In a `samAsa], the `upasarjana is (placed) before.

}

In the rules to come, anything stated in the first {s vibhakti} is placed first
in the compound, and anything in the third {s vibhakti} is placed second.


{h {s sup} deletion in a {s samAsa}}

Finally, we use this rule to delete the {s sup} ending of the first {s
subanta}:

{rule

supo dhAtuprAtipadikayoH | 2.4.71
supaH dhAtu-prAtipadikayoH
A `sup followed by a `dhAtu or a `prAtipadika [is replaced by `luk].

}

However, a very small number of {s samAsa}s do not use {s luk} here.
Fittingly, they are called {s-dfn aluk-samAsa}s. For example, the word {s
Atmanepadam} is an {s aluk-samAsa}.
