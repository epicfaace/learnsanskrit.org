{title {s zatR} and {s zAnac}}

To conclude this unit, let's learn about the {s pratyaya}s {s-dfn zatR~} and
{s-dfn zAnac}, which create words like the following:

{ex

gacchan
while going

labhamAnaH
while obtaining

}

{s zatR~} and {s zAnac} are {s sArvadhAtuka pratyaya}s, so they cause slightly
different changes from the {s ArdhadhAtuka kRt-pratyaya}s that we have seen so
far.


{h Defining the {s pratyaya}s}

{s zatR~} and {s zAnac} are replacements for {s la~T} and {s lR~T}:

{rule

vartamAne laT | 3.3.123
_
[The `pratyaya] `la~T [is added after a `dhAtu] in the sense of present action.

laTaH zatRzanacAvaprathamAsamAnAdhikaraNe | 3.2.124 
la~TaH zatR~-zAnacau a-prathamA-samAnAdhikaraNe
`la~T is replaced by `zatR~ or `zAnac when not coreferent with a [nominal] in
the first [`vibhakti],

lakSaNahetvoH kriyAyAH | 3.2.126
lakSaNa-hetvoH kriyAyAH
or when it is a sign or cause of the action.

tau sat | 3.2.127 
_
These two [`pratyaya_s] are called `sat.

lRTaH sadvA | 3.3.14
lR~TaH sat vA
`sat optionally replaces `lR~T.

}

But how do we decide whether to use {s zatR~} or {s zAnac}? Simply, we use the
one that matches the {s pada} that the {s dhAtu} requires. Recall these two
rules:

{rule

laH parasmaipadam | 1.4.99
_
[The replacements for] `laH are called `parasmaipada.

taGAnAvAtmanepadam | 1.4.100
taG-Anau Atmanepadam
The `taG `pratyaya_s and [the `pratyaya] `Ana are called `Atmanepada.

}

By rule 1.4.99, {s zatR~} is {s parasmaipada} and replaces a {s parasmaipada
pratyaya}. And likewise, {s zAnac} is {s Atmanepada} by rule 1.4.100 and
replaces an {s Atmanepada pratyaya}.

{aside
The {s Ana} in rule 1.4.100 includes {s zAnac} and related {s pratyaya}s like
{s zAnan} and {s cAnaz}.)
}


{h Adding {s vikaraNa}s}

Since {s zatR~} and {s zAnac} are both {s zit}, they are both {s sArvadhAtuka
pratyaya}s:

{rule

tiGzitsArvadhAtukam | 3.4.113 
tiG-zit sArvadhAtukam
`tiG `pratyaya_s and `zit `kRt `pratyaya_s are called `sArvadhAtuka.

}

which means that they allow the normal {s vikaraNa} rules to apply. For
example:

{rule

kartari zap | 3.1.68 
_
[The `kRt `pratyaya] `zap [is added] in `kartari-prayoga (agentive usage)
[after the `dhAtu when a `sArvadhAtuka suffix follows].

}

For a larger list of such rules, refer back to our {url[r=vyakarana.lesson
topic=tinanta slug=vikarana] lesson on {s vikaraNa}s}.

Otherwise, these {s pratyaya}s cause the standard sound changes.


{h Sample {s prakriya}s}

{s bhavat} is derived as follows:

{prakriya

bhU | 1.3.1
bhU la~T | 1.3.3; 1.3.5; 1.3.9
bhU la~T | 1.3.78
bhU zatR~ | 3.2.124
bhU at | 1.3.2; 1.3.8; 1.3.9
bhU zap at | 3.1.68
bhU a at | 1.3.2; 1.3.8; 1.3.9
bho a at | 7.3.84
bhav a at | 6.1.78
bhavat | 6.1.97

}

This {s prakriyA} uses rule 6.1.97, which prevents the bad result *{s bhavAt}:

{rule

ato guNe | 6.1.97
ataH guNe
[Non-word-final] `a is deleted when a `guNa [vowel] follows.

}

{s zRNvat} is derived as follows:

{prakriya

zru | 1.3.1
zru la~T | 1.3.3; 1.3.5; 1.3.9
zru la~T | 1.3.78
zru zatR~ | 3.2.124
zru at | 1.3.2; 1.3.8; 1.3.9
zR znu at | 3.1.74
zR znu at | 1.3.8; 1.3.9
zR nu at | 1.2.4
zR nv at | 6.1.77
zRNvat | 8.4.1

}

This {s prakriyA} uses rule 1.2.4, which prevents the bad result *{s zarNvat}:

{rule

sArvadhAtukamapit | 1.2.4 
sArvadhAtukam a-pit
`sArvadhAtuka [suffixes] that are not `pit [are treated as `Git].

}
