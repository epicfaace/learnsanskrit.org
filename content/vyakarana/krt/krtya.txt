{title {s kRtya}}

Let's begin by studying a subtype of the {s kRt-pratyaya} called {s-dfn kRtya}.
{s kRtya-pratyaya}s include common suffixes like {s -tavya} and {s -anIya}.
They generally convey the sense that something "should be done" or "must be
done."


{h Defining the {s pratyaya}}

We start with a new {s adhikAra}:

{rule

kRtyAH | 3.1.95
kRtyAH
&hellip; is a `kRtya suffix.

}

The rules that follow this {s adhikAra} define all of the members of the class,
but since the list is quite long, we include only a few of the more common
ones:

{rule

tavyattavyAnIyaraH | 3.1.96
tavyat-tavya-anIyaraH
[The following are called `kRtya, `kRt, and `pratyaya and follow a `dhAtu]:
`tavyat, `tavya, and `anIyar;

aco yat | 3.1.97
acaH yat
After vowels, `yat;

RhalorNyat | 3.1.124
R-haloH Nyat
After `R, `RR, or a consonant, `Nyat.

}

All of these {s pratyaya}s are stated in their {s upadeza} form. Here, the last
{s t} on {s tavyat}, {s yat}, and {s Nyat} is stated for accent purposes; by
rule {a-cite 6.1.185}, all three of these {s pratyaya}s will have a {s svarita}
on their first vowels.

Meanwhile, the meaning of the {s kRtya-pratyaya}s is defined later in chapter
3:

{rule

AvazyakAdhamarNyayorNiniH | 3.3.170
Avazyaka-AdhamarNyayoH Nini~H
The [`pratyaya] `Nini~ is used in the sense of `Avazyaka (necessity) or
`AdhamarNya (owing a debt).

kRtyAzca | 3.3.171
kRtyAH ca
Likewise for the `kRtya [`pratyaya_s],

zaki liGca | 3.3.172
zaki liG ca
which, along with `liG, also has the sense of `zak (to be capable of).

}

{s kRtya} expresses only {s karmaNi} and {s bhAve prayoga}, per rule 3.4.69
below:

{rule

laH karmaNi ca bhAve cAkarmakebhyaH | 3.4.69
laH karmaNi ca bhAve ca akarmakebhyaH
The `lakAra_s denote [`kartari `prayoga] as well as `karmaNi and `bhAve
`prayoga when the verb is `akarmaka (intransitive).

tayoreva kRtyaktakhalarthAH | 3.4.70
tayoH eva kRtya-kta-khalarthAH
`kRtya, `kta, and [a `pratyaya] having the meaning of `khal express these two
[i.e. `karmaNi and `bhAve `prayoga].

}


{h Sound changes}

{s kRtya-pratyaya}s follow the normal pattern of all {s kRt-pratyaya}s and
generally cause {s guNa} changes to the vowel in the {s aGga}.

{note
For {s pratyaya}s that start with {s t}, such as {s tavya}, various sandhi
changes might occur between that {s t} and the {s dhAtu}'s last consonant.
Those changes are complicated and detailed, so we will omit them from this
lesson.
}


{h Sample {s prakriyA}s}

Here are some example {s prakriyA}s that use the rules above. Typically, only
the essential rules of a {s prakriyA} are provided. But for clarity, we will
include all of the applicable rules here.

First, an example with {s kR} and {s tavya-pratyaya}. Since {s kR} has an {s
anudAtta} accent in its {s upadeza} form, it is prevented from using the
connecting {s iT} vowel by rule 7.2.10:

{prakriya

DukRJ | 1.3.1
kR | 1.3.3; 1.3.5; 1.3.9
kR tavya | 3.3.171; 3.1.96; 3.4.114
kR tavya | 7.2.10
kartavya | 7.3.84; 1.1.51

}

Next, an example with {s bhU} and {s tavya-pratyaya} again. Since {s bhU} does
not have an {s anudAtta} accent in its {s upadeza} form, it uses the connecting
{s iT} vowel by rule 7.2.35:

{prakriya

bhU | 1.3.1
bhU tavya | 3.3.171; 3.1.96; 3.4.114
bhU iT tavya | 7.2.35
bhU i tavya | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
bho i tavya | 7.3.84
bhavitavya | 6.1.78

}

Third, an example with {s bhU} and {s anIya-pratyaya}. Since {s anIya} starts
with a vowel, it is not in scope for {a-cite 7.2.35}, which would otherwise add
a connecting {s iT} vowel:

{prakriya

bhU | 1.3.1
bhU anIya | 3.3.171; 3.1.96; 3.4.114
bho anIya | 7.3.84
bhavanIya | 6.1.78

}

Fourth, an example with {s kR} and {s Nyat-pratyaya}. Since {s Nyat} has {s N}
as an {s it}, it causes a {s vRddhi} change instead of a {s guNa} change:

{prakriya

DukRJ | 1.3.1
kR | 1.3.3; 1.3.5; 1.3.9
kR Nyat | 3.3.171; 3.1.124; 3.4.114
kR ya | 1.3.3; 1.3.7; 1.3.9
kArya | 7.2.115; 1.1.51

}

Finally, an example with {s bhU} and {s yat-pratyaya}:

{prakriya

bhU | 1.3.1
bhU yat | 3.3.171; 3.1.97; 3.4.114
bhU ya | 1.3.3; 1.3.9
bho ya | 7.3.84
bhavya | 6.1.79

}

For {s bhavya}, we use rule 6.1.79, which we have not previously seen:

{rule

eco 'yavAyAvaH | 6.1.78
ecaH ay-av-Ay-AvaH
An `ec vowel becomes `ay, `av, `Ay, or `Av, respectively [when a vowel follows
in `saMhitA].

vAnto yi pratyaye | 6.1.79
va-antaH yi pratyaye
(The changes ending in) `v (i.e. `o to `av and `au to `Av) (take effect) when
followed by the `y of a `pratyaya.

}
