{title {s kta}}

In this lesson, we will learn about a slightly more complicated {s pratyaya}:
the {s-dfn kta-pratyaya}.

{s kta} has a {s k} as an {s it}, which means that it prevents {s guNa}
changes.  Additionally, {s kta} causes certain {s dhAtu}s to undergo a change
called {s-dfn samprasAraNa}, which we describe further below.


{h Defining the {s pratyaya}}

The definition of {s kta} is somewhat roundabout. First, both {s kta} and {s
ktavatu~} are labeled as {s niSThA} by this {s saMjJA} rule:

{rule

ktaktavatU niSThA | 1.1.26
kta-ktavatU niSThA
The (`pratyaya_s) `kta and `ktavatu~ are called `niSThA.

}

Through this definition, both of these {s pratyaya}s are defined as referring
to the past tense in chapter 3:

{rule

bhUte | 3.2.84
_
In the past tense, &hellip;

niSThA | 3.2.102
_
The `niSThA `pratyaya_s [are used in the sense of the past tense].

}

However, {s kta} (but not {s ktavatu~}) additionally implies {s bhAve} or {s
karmaNi prayoga} (roughly, stative or passive action), through rule 3.4.70,
which we saw in the lesson on {s kRtya-pratyaya}s:

{rule

tayoreva kRtyaktakhalarthAH | 3.4.70
tayoH eva kRtya-kta-khal-arthAH
`kRtya, `kta, and [a `pratyaya] having the meaning of `khal express these two
[i.e. `karmaNi and `bhAve `prayoga].

}

As well as some minor usages in {s kartari prayoga}:

{rule

AdikarmaNi ktaH kartari ca | 3.4.71
Adi-karmaNi ktaH kartari ca
In [the sense of] the start of an action, `kta also expresses `kartari
`prayoga.

gatyarthAkarmakazliSazIGsthAsavasajanaruhajIryatibhyazca | 3.4.72
gatyartha-akarmaka-zliSa~-zIG-sthA-Asa~-vasa~-jana~-ruha~-jIryatibhyaH ca
Likewise after [`dhAtu_s] that imply motion or are intransitive, as well as the
[`dhAtu_s] `zliS, `zI, `sthA, `As, `vas, `jan, `ruh, and `jRR.

}


{h Sound changes}

As a reminder, {s kRt-pratyaya}s generally cause a {s guNa} change based on
rule 7.3.84:

{rule

sArvadhAtukArdhadhAtukayoH | 7.3.84 
sArvadhAtuka-ArdhadhAtukayoH
[An `aGga is replaced with `guNa] when followed by a `sArvadhAtuka or
`ArdhadhAtuka suffix.

}

But since {s kta} has {s k} as an {s it} -- or to put it another way, because
{s kta} is {s kit} -- this change is blocked by rule 1.1.5:

{rule

kGiti ca | 1.1.5 
k-Giti ca
[`guNa and `vRddhi replace the `ik vowels, but not] when followed by [terms
that are] `kit or `Git.

}

So in general, the vowel change here is simple: there isn't one! But in
addition to this general behavior, {s kit pratyaya}s can also cause specific
{s dhAtu}s to undergo extra changes.

One change is that certain roots ending in a nasal sound lose that nasal sound: 

{rule

anudAttopadezavanatitanotyAdInAmanunAsikalopo jhali kGiti | 6.4.37
anudAtta-upadeza-vanati-tanoti-AdInAm anunAsika-lopaH jhali k-Giti
A `dhAtu with an `anudAtta vowel in `upadeza, as well as [the `dhAtu`] `van and
[the `dhAtu_s]in the list starting with `tan, lose their final `anunAsika when
followed by a `kit or `Git [`pratyaya] starting with a `jhal consonant.

}

An example:

{ex

gam + ta > gata
gone (to)

}

Another change is sometimes called {s samprasAraNa}. Through this process, the
semivowel in a {s dhAtu} first becomes a vowel:

{rule

igyaNaH samprasAraNam | 1.1.45
ik yaNaH samprasAraNam
The substitution of an `ik sound in place of a `yaN sound is called
`samprasAraNa.

}

And then deletes the following vowel, through a rule of {s ac-sandhi}:

{rule

samprasAraNAcca | 6.1.108
samprasAraNAt ca
Additionoally, [the first of two vowels is retained] when the first vowel is
`samprasAraNa.

}

Here are some examples of the change:

{ex

vac + ta > uac + ta > uc + ta
spoken

yaj + ta > iaj + ta > ij + ta
sacrificed

}

And here are the {s dhAtu}s that use {s samprasAraNa} when a {s kit pratyaya}
follows:

{rule

vacisvapiyajAdInAM kiti | 6.1.15
vaci~-svapi~-yajAdInAm kiti
[The `dhAtu_s] `vac, `svap, and those in the list beginning with `yaj [undergo
`samprasAraNa] when followed by a `kit [`pratyaya].

grahijyAvayivyadhivaSTivicativRzcatipRcchatibhRjjatInAM Giti ca | 6.1.16
grahi~-jyA-vayi~-vyadhi~-vaSTi-vicati-vRzcati-pRcchati-bhRjjatInAm Giti ca
This applies to `grah, `jyA, `vay as a substitution for `veJ, `vyadh, `vaz,
`vyac, `vrasc, `pracch, and `bhrasj as well, which all also make the same
change when followed by a `Git [`pratyaya].

}


{h Sample {s prakriyA}s}

First, an example with {s kR}. Since {s kR} has an {s anudAtta} accent in its
{s upadeza} form, it is prevented from using the connecting {s iT} vowel by
rule 7.2.10:

{prakriya

DukRJ | 1.3.1
kR | 1.3.3; 1.3.5; 1.3.9
kR kta | 3.2.102; 3.4.70
kR ta | 1.3.8; 1.3.9
kRta | 7.2.10

}

Next, an example with {s gam} showing {s lopa} of the final {s m}. {s gam}
also has an {s anudAtta} accent in its {s upadeza} form, so it likewise
has no connecting {s iT} vowel:

{prakriya

gamL~ | 1.3.1
gam | 1.3.2; 1.3.9
gam kta | 3.2.102; 3.4.72
gam ta | 1.3.8; 1.3.9
gam ta | 7.2.10
gata | 6.4.98

}


Finally, an example with {s sup} showing {s samprasAraNa}. As in the examples
above, {s iT} is not used:

{prakriya

JiSvapa~ | 1.3.1
Svap | 1.3.2; 1.3.5; 1.3.9
svap | 6.1.64
svap kta | 3.2.102; 3.4.72
svap ta | 1.3.8; 1.3.9
svap ta | 7.2.10
suap ta | 6.1.15
supta | 6.1.108

}
