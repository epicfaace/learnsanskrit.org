{title Introduction}

Almost all of chapter 3 of the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} focuses specifically on the {s
pratyaya}s (suffixes) that we add directly to a {s dhAtu}. These {s pratyaya}s
come in four main types.

The first type is the {s sanAdi-pratyaya}, which creates new {s dhAtu}s:

{ex

gam + [san] > jigamiSa
want to go

kR + [Nic] > kAri
cause to do or make

}

The second type is the {s tiG-pratyaya}, which creates {s tiGanta}s (verbs):

{ex

gam + [tip] > gacchati
(someone) goes

kR + [Nal] > cakAra
(someone) did

}

The third type is the {s vikaraNa}, which we add between a {s dhAtu} and the {s
pratyaya} that follows it:

{ex

bhU + [zap] + ti > bhavati
(someone) becomes

krI + [znA] + mi > krINAmi
I buy

}

And the fourth type, the {s-dfn kRt-pratyaya}, is any other {s pratyaya} we can
add. {s kRt-pratyaya}s create {s prAtipadika}s (stems) that eventually become
{s subanta}s:

{ex

yuj + [ghaJ] > yogaH
yoga

budh + [ktvA] > buddhvA
after waking up

pac + [Nvul] > pAcakaH
cooker

}

In this unit, we will learn about some of common {s kRt-pratyaya}s and
understand some of the sandhi changes they cause.


{h General rules for {s kRt-pratyaya}s}

All {s kRt-pratyaya}s are declared within the scope of these four {s adhikAra}
rules:

{rule

pratyayaH | 3.1.1
_
&hellip; is a `pratyaya (suffix).

parazca | 3.1.2
paraH ca
&hellip; and [it is inserted] after [the base].

dhAtoH | 3.1.91
dhAtoH
After a `dhAtu, &hellip;

kRdatiG | 3.1.93
kRt a-tiG
&hellip; is called `kRt if it is not `tiG.

}

Together, these four {s adhikAra} rules mean "&hellip; is added as a
{s kRt-pratyaya} after a {s dhAtu}, if it is not a {s tiG-pratyaya}."

Further, these two {s samjJA} rules will add extra labels to any {s pratyaya}
we introduce within the scope of these rules:

{rule

tiGzitsArvadhAtukam | 3.4.113 
tiG-zit sArvadhAtukam
`tiG and [`kRt-pratyayas that are] `zit (i.e. with `z as an `it) are called
`sArvadhAtuka.

ArdhadhAtukaM zeSaH | 3.4.114 
ArdhadhAtukam zeSaH
All other [`kRt-pratyaya_s] are called `ArdhadhAtuka.

}

That is, {s kRt-pratyaya}s are generally labeled {s ArdhadhAtuka}; but if they
have {s z} as an {s it} letter, they are labeled {s sArvadhAtuka} instead.


{h Sound changes}

{s kRt-pratyaya}s cause various sound changes. Generally, they cause {s guNa}
changes by the following rules:

{rule

aGgasya | 6.4.1
_
Of an `aGga (the base before a suffix), &hellip;

miderguNaH | 7.3.83
mideH guNaH
The `i of `mid [as an `aGga] becomes `guNa.

sArvadhAtukArdhadhAtukayoH | 7.3.84 
sArvadhAtuka-ArdhadhAtukayoH
[The final of an `aGga is replaced with `guNa] when followed by a `sArvadhAtuka
or `ArdhadhAtuka suffix.

pugantalaghUpadhasya ca | 7.3.86
pu~k-anta-laghu-upadhasya ca
A `laghu (prosodically light) penultimate or a vowel followed by [the augment]
`pu~k [in an `aGga is replaced with `guNa when followed by a `sArvadhAtuka or
`ArdhadhAtuka suffix].

}

But if they have {s J} or {s N} as {s it} letters, they can cause {s
vRddhi} changes instead:

{rule

mRjervRddhiH | 7.2.114
mRjeH vRddhiH
The `R of `mRj [as an `aGga] becomes `vRddhi.

aco JNiti | 7.2.115
acaH JNiti
The `ac [of an `aGga becomes `vRddhi] if followed by `Jit or `Nit.

ata upadhAyAH | 7.2.116
ataH upadhAyAH
The penultimate `at [of an `aGga becomes `vRddhi if followed by `Jit or `Nit].

}

And as a reminder, {s guNa} and {s vRddhi} substitutions are defined only for
specific vowels:

{rule

iko guNavRddhI | 1.1.3
ikaH guNa-vRddhI
`guNa and `vRddhi replace the `ik vowels,

}

And they are blocked if the {s pratyaya} has {s k} or {s G} as an {s
it} letter:

{rule

kGiti ca | 1.1.5 
k-Giti ca
but [not] when followed by [terms that are] `kit or `Git.

}


{h {s iT}}

Sometimes, an {s i} vowel will be added between the {s dhAtu} and the {s
pratyaya}:

{ex

bhU + tum > bhavitum
to become

}

This {s i} vowel is called {s-dfn iT} (not to be confused with {s it}, which
refers to the "tag" letters on a term in {s upadeza}). Certain roots use {s
iT}, certain roots don't, and some roots use it optionally.

The specific rules for using {s iT} are complex and detailed, but two rules sum
up the general idea. Generally, any {s ArdhadhAtuka} suffix that starts with a
consonant other than {s y} will use {s iT}:

{rule

ArdhadhAtukasyeDvalAdeH | 7.2.35
ArdhadhAtukasya iT val-AdeH
[`iT is added] to an `ArdhadhAtuka (`pratyaya) that starts with `val (any
consonant other than `y).

}

But if the {s dhAtu} has an {s anudAtta} accent in its {s upadeza} form, then
{s iT} is not used:

{rule

ekAca upadeze'nudAttAt | 7.2.10
eka-acakaH upadeze anudAttAt
After [a `dhAtu] that has exactly one vowel and that has an `anudAtta accent in
`upadeza, [`iT is not used].

}
