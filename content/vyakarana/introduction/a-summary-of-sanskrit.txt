{title A summary of Sanskrit}

If you know {strong zero} Sanskrit, you can still follow along with our series.
But it certainly helps to have a basic sense of what Sanskrit is like and how
it works. That's what we hope to give you here.


{h The alphabet}

{note
We're still adding audio to our website. For now, you can listen to all of
these sounds through
{a[href=https://ubcsanskrit.ca/lesson1/devan%C4%81gar%C4%AB.html] this
resource} from the University of British Columbia.
}

Sanskrit is written phonetically. Each sound has one symbol, and each symbol
corresponds to one sound. The sounds below are provided in both the usual
Devanagari script ({d saMskRtam}) and in romanized Sanskrit ({s saMskRtam}).
All Devanagari in our lessons will be displayed next to its romanized version.

These sounds are colored according to where in the mouth they are pronounced.
We will explain this system in the lessons to come.

{sounds-dr a-1 A-1 i-2 I-2 u-5 U-5}
{sounds-dr R-3 RR-3 L-4}
{sounds-dr e ai o au}
{sounds-dr aM aH-1}
{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1}
{sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}
{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3}
{sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}
{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5}
{sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5}
{sounds-dr za-2 Sa-3 sa-4 ha-1}

Given all of these sounds, we have the first question that the {cite
Aṣṭādhyāyī} aims to answer: {em which phonetic distinctions are relevant to
grammar?}


{h Sandhi}

In every spoken language, native speakers make subconscious changes to their
speech so that they can speak more quickly and fluently. For example, some
native English speakers might drop the final "g" of words like "running" or
"drinking." These kinds of changes are called {dfn sandhi}.

Sanskrit sandhi changes are extensive, and they are almost always written down.
These changes occur both within words and between words, and they depend both
on specific sounds and on the semantics of different words and suffixes.

Given these sandhi changes, we have a second question: {em which sandhi changes
apply in which contexts?}


{h Basic words}

Roughly, Sanskrit has three types of words. These are {dfn nominal} words
(nouns, adjectives, participles, and the like), {dfn verbs}, and a broad third
category we can call {dfn uninflected words}. The example below uses each of
these three word types:

{ex

rAmo na jagAma.
Rama didn't go.

}

Sanskrit also relies on something called {dfn inflection}. Inflection is when
we change part of a word to express a new meaning. English uses inflection in a
limited way: we have one {em cat} but two {em cats}. Or perhaps you {em ate}
yesterday but will {em eat} today. But Sanskrit nominals and verbs use
inflection much more extensively:

{ex

nayasi
You lead

nIyeran
They might be led.

neSyatAm
of those about to lead

ninISantaH
those who want to lead

gajAya
for the elephant

gajeSu
among the (many) elephants

}

and in much more elaborate patterns, with multiple sandhi changes:

{ex

labhe
I obtain.

ruNadhmi
I obstruct.

}

This raises a third question: {em Which inflectional patterns apply in which
contexts, and with what semantics?}


{h Sentences}

Because Sanskrit words are highly inflected, Sanskrit does not usually depend
on a specific word order. For example, the two sentences below have the same
semantics:

{ex

rAmo rAvaNaM hanti
Rama kills Ravana.

rAvaNaM rAmo hanti
Rama kills Ravana.

}

Since word order is relatively unimportant in Sanskrit, the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}
focuses instead on a fourth question: {em how do words with different semantics
combine to express sentence-level semantics?}


{h The human constraint}

Finally, we should remember that the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} is part of a culture
that values oral tradition and memorization. So a fifth question it tries to
address is a pragmatic one: {em how can this system be compressed to the
smallest possible form, so that it is easy to memorize and easy to recall?}

With this basic framing, we are ready to begin.
