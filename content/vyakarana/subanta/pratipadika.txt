{title {s prAtipadika}}

Our {s prakriyA} begins with a {s-dfn prAtipadika} ("pre-word," "nominal
stem"). We then find an appropriate ending for the {s prAtipadika}, apply any
necessary operations, and obtain our final word.

How do we define a {s prAtipadika}? First, we should remember this important {s
paribhASA}:

{rule

yena vidhistadantasya | 1.1.72
yena vidhiH tat-antasya
[A term] by which a rule [is specified refers to an item that] ends in that
[term].

}

We previously used this rule to define {s guNa} substitutions of the last vowel
of an {s aGga}:

{ex

nI + a > ne a

}

But here, we will use it to refer to different suffixes instead:

{rule

arthavadadhAturapratyayaH prAtipadikam | 1.2.45
arthavat a-dhAtuH a-pratyayaH prAtipadikam
A meaningful [term] that is neither a `dhAtu (verb root) nor a `pratyaya
(suffix), [nor a term ending in a `pratyaya, is called] `prAtipadika,

kRttaddhitasamAsAzca | 1.2.46
kRt-taddhita-samAsAH ca
and [terms ending with] `kRt or `taddhita [suffixes], as well as `samAsa_s
(compounds), [are called `prAtipadika].

}

{s-dfn kRt} suffixes attach to verb roots (as in {s man + tra} &rarr; {s
mantra}), {s-dfn taddhita} suffixes attach to other {s prAtipadika}s ({s amRta
+ tva} &rarr; {s amRtatva}), and {s samAsa}s are just compounds.

As a reminder, Sanskrit noun stems all express a certain gender, and the nominal
endings we use with that stem should match the stem's gender. For example, if
we want to use the masculine stem {s rAma}, we should not apply endings
associated with the feminine gender. But how do we know the gender associated
with the {s prAtipadika}?

In some instances, we don't have enough information to decide. But in general,
we can look at the different {s pratyaya}s that were used to create the {s
prAtipadika}. Based on these affixes, we can determine which gender is
associated with the {s prAtipadika} and which endings to use.

In the next lesson, we will continue the process of creating a {s subanta}.
