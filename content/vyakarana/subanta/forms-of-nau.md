{title Forms of {s nau}}

{s nau} is called {s prAtipadika} by rule {a-cite 1.2.45}, so we can add
{s sup} endings to it. By studying {s nau} and its endings, we can consolidate
what we have learned so far.

If we have a verb that expresses {s kartari prayoga}, then we can use {s prathamA-vibhakti} by rule {a-cite 2.3.46}. Then we can create our {s pada}:

{prakriya

nau su~ | 4.1.2
nau s | 1.3.2; 1.3.9
nau ru~ | 8.2.66
nauH | 8.3.15

}

The dual is simple:

{prakriya

nau au | 4.1.2
nAvau | 6.1.78

}

As is the plural:

{prakriya

nau jas | 4.1.2
nau as | 1.3.7; 1.3.9
nAv as | 6.1.78
nAv a ru~ | 8.2.66
nAvaH | 8.3.15

}

We select {s dvitIyA-vibhakti} with rule {a-cite 2.3.2} and can follow
similar steps to the ones above. We can follow a similar approach for {s
tRtIyA}, {s caturthI}, {s paJcamI}, and {s SaSThI}.

The plural of {s saptamI-vibhakti} has a small complication due to {s Satva}.
We can obtain {s Satva} because rule {a-cite 8.3.59} also includes {s
pratyaya}s:

{prakriya

nau su | 4.1.2
nauSu | 8.3.59

}

Finally, the condition of {s sambodhana} selects {s prathamA-vibhakti}, which
produces the forms we saw above.
