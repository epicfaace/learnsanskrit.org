{title {s kAraka}}

The Pāṇinian school assumes that sentences have a basic structure. There is a
verb, like {s gacchati} ("goes"), that describes some action. And there are
different components involved in this action:

{ex

rAmaH sItAyai vane mArgeNa kuTyA mRgaM [gacchati].
Rama [goes] to the deer in the forest from the hut via the path for Sita.

}

The different components of some action are called {s-dfn kAraka}s. Roughly,
you can think of a {s kAraka} as an intermediate idea between the meaning we
want to express and the actual {s sup} ending we use.

Review lesson.

{h {s adhikAra} rules}

The {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī} describes six main {s kAraka}s and does so within the
scope of these two rules, which we've seen before:

{rule

A kaDArAdekA saMjJA | 1.4.1
A kaDArAt ekA saMjJA
Up to the `kaDAra rule (rule 2.2.38), one `saMjJA [is allowed].

vipratiSedhe paraM kAryam | 1.4.2
vipratiSedhe param kAryam
In matters of conflict, the later [rule] should be applied.

}

The {s kAraka} section then begins with this {s adhikAra}:

{rule

kArake | 1.4.23
_
In the context of a `kAraka, &hellip;

}

{h The six {s kAraka}s}

Below, we present the basic semantics of the six {s kAraka}s. We also include
some common secondary semantics. Most of these six {s kAraka}s can convey
several other kinds of semantics, but we have omitted them here to keep this
lesson at a reasonable length.

The first {s kAraka} is {s-dfn apAdAna}, which is usually expressed by the
fifth ("ablative") case:

{rule

dhruvamapAye 'pAdAnam | 1.4.24
dhruvam apAye apAdAnam
In the sense of movement away, [a `kAraka that is] the fixed point is called
`apAdAna (ablation).

bhItrArthAnAM bhayahetuH | 1.4.25
bhI-trA-arthAnAm bhaya-hetuH
For [roots] meaning `bhI (to fear) or `trA (to protect), [a `kAraka that is]
the source of fear [is called `apAdAna].

}

Here are some examples of these two rules:

{ex

naro [vanAd] grAmaM gacchati.
The man goes [from the forest] to the village.

rAvaNo [rAmAd] bhItaH.
Ravana is afraid [of Rama].

rAmaH sItAM [rAkSasAt] trAyate.
Rama protects Sita [from a rakshasa].

}

Next is {s-dfn sampradAna}, which is usually expressed by the fourth
("dative") case:

{rule

karmaNA yam abhipraiti sa sampradAnam | 1.4.32
_
[A `kAraka that is] whom one aims to benefit with the action is called
`sampradAna (beneficiary).

rucyarthAnAM prIyamANaH | 1.4.33
ruci~-arthAnAm prIyamaNaH
For [roots] meaning `ruc (please), [a `kAraka that is] the one being pleased
[is called `sampradAna].

zlAghahnuGsthAzapAM jJIpsyamAnaH | 1.4.34
zlAgha~-hnuG-sthA-zapAm jJIpsyamAnaH
For the roots `zlAgh (praise), `hnu (hide), `sthA (stay, stand), and `zap (vow,
curse), [a `kAraka that is] the one whom one wishes to be informed [of the
action is called `sampradAna].

}

Here are some examples of these three rules:

{ex

[devadattAya] phalaM dadAti
He gives a fruit [to Devadatta]. (1.4.32)

[devadattAya] rocate phalam.
[Devadatta] likes the fruit. (1.4.33)

[devadattAya] zlAghate
He praises [Devadatta]. (1.4.34)

}

Next is {s-dfn karaNa}, which is usually expressed by the third
("instrumental") case:

{rule

sAdhakatamaM karaNam | 1.4.42
sAdhakatamam karaNam
[A `kAraka that is] the most effectual means [is called] `karaNa (means).

}

And an example:

{ex

rAmo [dhanuSA] rAvaNaM hanti.
Rama kills Ravana [with his bow].

}

Then {s-dfn adhikaraNa}, which is usually expressed by the seventh
("locative") case:

{rule

AdhAro 'dhikaraNam | 1.4.45
AdhAraH adhikaraNam
[A `kAraka that is] the locus of action [is called] `adhikaraNa (locus).

}

And an example:

{ex

arjunaH [kSetre] yudhyate.
Arjuna fights [in the field].

}

Then {s-dfn karma}, which is usually expressed by the second ("accusative")
case:

{rule

karturIpsitatamaM karma | 1.4.49
kartuH Ipsitatamam karma
[A `kAraka that is] what the agent most desires [is called] `karma (object),

tathAyuktaM cAnIpsitam | 1.4.50
tathA-yuktam ca an-Ipsitam
and likewise for what is not desired but similarly related [to what is most desired].

}

What does rule 1.4.50 mean? To help us understand, here is an ancient example:

{ex

[odanaM] bhuJjAno [viSaM] bhuGkte
While eating [rice], he eats [poison].

}

Here, {s odanam} ("rice") is what the eater desires by his action, so it is {s
karma} by rule 1.4.49. {s viSam} ("poison") is not desired; perhaps the eater
doesn't know that the poison is present. So {s viSam} is out of scope in rule
1.4.49.  However, {s viSam} has a similar relation to {s odanam}, since it is
connected with {s odanam} by being mixed with it. Thus {s viSam} can be called
{s karma} by rule 1.1.50.

Our last {s kAraka} is {s-dfn kartR}, which is usually expressed in either the
first ("nominative") or the third ("instrumental") case, depending on the
verb's {s prayoga}:

{rule

svatantraH kartA | 1.4.54
sva-tantraH kartA
[A `kAraka that is] independent [is called] `kartR (agent),

tatprayojako hetuzca | 1.4.55
tat-prayojakaH hetuH ca
[A `kAraka that is] the instigator of that [action is called `kartR] as well as
`hetu (cause).

}


Here are some examples of these rules:

{ex

[devadatta] odanam pacati.
[Devadatta] cooks rice.

[rAma] odanaM devadattena pAcayati.
[Rama] makes Devadatta cook rice.

}


{h Review}

{s kAraka} is a complex concept, but we hope the rules above give you some
intuition for what it represents. Even so, we're still left with two questions:

{ul
    {li How do we map a {s kAraka} to a specific ending?}
    {li What if we want to express something that isn't a {s kAraka}?}
}

In the next lesson, we will answer these questions and finally select a {s
vibhakti}.
