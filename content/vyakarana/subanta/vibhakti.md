{title {s vibhakti}}

Sanskrit resources written in English often say that Sanskrit nominals use
eight different {dfn cases}. Roughly, the English concept of {em case} is like
a combination of two Sanskrit categories: {s kAraka} and {s vibhakti}.

{s-dfn vibhakti} is simply a group of three endings, as we saw previously. The
{s sup pratyAhAra} has twenty-one endings, so it has seven {s vibhakti}s in
total.

A given {s vibhakti} can express multiple {s kAraka}s, and it can also express
relationships that aren't {s kAraka}s. By using the rules below, we can pick
the right {s vibhakti} for our {s prAtipadika} and get one step closer to our
completed word.

{h {s adhikAra rules}}

There is only one {s adhikAra} we should consider here, but it is a significant
one:

{rule

anabhihite | 2.3.1
_
When not otherwise expressed, &hellip;

}

The idea is that the rules below can only be applied if their information has
not been expressed already. To understand what this means, we can start by
examining the use of the second {s vibhakti}:


{h The second {s vibhakti}}

The first rule after rule {a-cite 2.3.1} is about the second {s vibhakti}:

{rule

karmaNi dvitIyA | 2.3.2
_
[When not otherwise expressed,] the second [`vibhakti is used] in the sense
of `karma.

}

Suppose the verb in our sentence is {s gacchati} ("goes"). {s gacchati} is in
{s kartari prayoga}, which means that expresses the {s kAraka} of {s kartR}. {s
gacchati} does not express any information about the {s karma}, so we can apply
rule 2.3.2 and create a valid sentence:

{ex

grAmaM gacchati
He goes to the village.

}

But suppose that the verb in our sentence is {s gamyate} ("is gone to"). {s
gamyate} is in {s karmaNi prayoga}, which means that it expresses the {s
kAraka} of {s karma}. Since {s karma} is already expressed, we cannot apply
rule 2.3.2. So we are prevented from saying *{s grAmaM gamyate}, which would be
an error. This is the purpose of rule {a-cite 2.3.1}.


{h The fourth {s vibhakti}}

Continuing on, we see some rules about the fourth {s vibhakti}:

{rule

caturthI sampradAne | 2.3.13
_
[When not otherwise expressed,] the fourth [`vibhakti is used] in the sense
of `sampradAna.

tumarthAcca bhAvavacanAt | 2.3.15
tum-arthAt ca bhAva-vacanAt
And after words that express `bhAva (state) in the sense of `tum.

}

Rule 2.3.13 is straightforward. Rule 2.3.15 refers to usages like the one below:

{ex

darzanAya gacchati.
He goes to see ("for seeing").

}


{h The third {s vibhakti}}

Next we have the third {s vibhakti}:

{rule

kartRkaraNayostRtIyA | 2.3.18
kartR-karaNayoH tRtIyA
[When not otherwise expressed,] the third [`vibhakti is used] in the sense
of `kartR or `karaNa.

sahayukte 'pradhAne | 2.3.19
saha-yukte a-pradhAne
[When not otherwise expressed, the third `vibhakti is used] with the word `saha
in the sense of a secondary [idea].

}

Rule 2.3.18 has the same behavior as {s karmaNi dvitIyA} above. If the verb is
in {s kartari prayoga} ({s gacchati}), it may express the {s karaNa}:

{ex

azvena gacchati.
He goes by horse.

}

And if the verb is in {s karmaNi prayoga} ({s gamyate}), it may express the {s
kartR}:

{ex

nareNa grAmo gamyate.
The man goes to the village. ("The village is gone to by the man.")

}


{h The fifth {s vibhakti}}

Next we have the fifth {s vibhakti}:

{rule

apAdAne paJcamI | 2.3.28
_
[When not otherwise expressed,] the fifth [`vibhakti is used] in the sense
of `apAdAna.

}

This is straightforward.


{h The seventh {s vibhakti}}

Next is the seventh {s vibhakti}. It inherits some context from a previous
rule. This extra context is minor, but we include it for the sake of
completeness:

{rule

saptamyadhikaraNe ca | 2.3.35
saptamI adhikaraNe ca
[When not otherwise expressed,] the seventh [`vibhakti] is used in the sense of
`adhikaraNa, [and after words that mean `dUra (far) or `antika (near)].

}


{h The first {s vibhakti}}

The first {s vibhakti} has a surprising definition. This rule, especially,
makes clear the difference between case and {s vibhakti}:

{rule

prAtipadikArthaliGgaparimANavacanamAtre prathamA | 2.3.46
prAtipadika-artha-liGga-parimANa-vacana-mAtre prathamA
[When not otherwise expressed,] the first [`vibhakti] is used only to express
its `prAtipadika meaning, gender, measure, and number.

}

Let's leave aside "measure," which is a minor point. What this rule says is
that the first {s vibhakti} does not express any {s kAraka} at all!

Why is this so? Once again, consider the verb that would be used with this {s
subanta}. If the verb is {s gacchati}, then {s kartR} is already expressed. So
the only new information that the first {s vibhakti} can express is the basic
information listed in the rule above. And the same applies if the verb is {s
gamyate}:

{ex

[rAmo] gacchati.
Rama goes.

[rAmo] gamyate.
Rama is gone to.

}

Finally, the first {s vibhakti} can express the same semantics as the vocative
case:

{rule

sambodhane ca | 2.3.47
_
[When not otherwise expressed, the first `vibhakti] is also used in the sense
of `sambodhana ("calling out")

ekavacanaM sambuddhiH | 2.3.49
ekavacanam sambuddhiH
[When not otherwise expressed, the first `vibhakti] `ekavacanam (singular) 
[is called] `sambuddiH.

}

{h The sixth {s vibhakti}}

Finally, we have the sixth {s vibhakti}:

{rule

SaSThI zeSe | 2.3.50
_
[When not otherwise expressed], the sixth [`vibhakti] is used in all remaining
senses.

}

Thus the sixth {s vibhakti} is a "catch-all" that expresses all sorts of
complex relationships.


{h Review}

In the next lesson, we will use what we have learned so far to generate
different forms of the feminine stem {s nau}.
