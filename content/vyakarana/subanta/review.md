{title Review}

In this unit, we extended our basic system to the task of deriving Sanskrit
nominals. We saw that the process has a few basic steps:

{ol
    {li Choose or create a {s prAtipadika}.}
    {li Choose the appropriate {s kAraka} (if applicable) and {s vibhakti}.}
    {li Select an appropriate {s sup-pratyaya}.}
    {li Apply any relevant changes to the {s sup-pratyaya}.}
    {li Apply sandhi rules.}
}


{h Index of rules}

{table
{tr {th Rules} {th Topic}}
{tr {td 1.4.23 - 1.4.55} {td Use of {s kAraka}}}
{tr {td 2.3.1 - 2.3.73} {td Use of {s vibhakti}}}
}


{h For further reading}

The closest English counterpart to {s kAraka} is the theta role
({a[href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_role] Wikipedia}). But we
should be very careful about understanding Indian categories through a Western
lens.
