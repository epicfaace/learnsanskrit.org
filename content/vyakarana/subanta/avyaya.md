{title {s avyaya}}

Uninflected words are called {s-dfn avyaya} ("unchanging"). In the Paṇinian
system, they are treated like a kind of {s subanta}, which makes them a type of
{s pada}:

{rule

suptiGantaM padam | 1.4.14
sup-tiG-antam padam
That which ends in `sup or `tiG [is called] a `pada (word).

}

To understand how this works, let'


{h What is an {s avyaya}?}

The {s avyaya} is a large category that includes many different kinds of terms:

{rule

svarAdinipAtamavyayam | 1.1.37
svar-Adi-nipAtam avyayam
The words in the list beginning with `svar, as well as a `nipAta, are called
`avyaya.

taddhitazcAsarvavibhaktiH | 1.1.38
taddhitaH ca a-sarva-vibhaktiH
Likewise for `taddhita suffixes not used in all `vibhakti_s;

kRnmejantaH | 1.1.39
kRt m-ec-antaH
`krt suffixes that end in `m or an `ec vowel;

ktvAtosunkasunaH | 1.1.40
ktvA-tosun-kasunaH
the suffixes `tvA, `tosu~n, and `kasu~n;

avyayIbhAvazca | 1.1.41
avyayIbhAvaH ca
and the `avyayIbhAva.

}

{s svarAdi} refers to a list of words in the {cite Gaṇapāṭha}, one of the
secondary texts used with the {cite Aṣṭādhyāyī}. The {s svarAdi} list includes
words like {s svar}, {s antar}, and {s hyas}, among many others. {s nipAta}
refers to a subtype of {s avyaya} that includes words like {s ca}, {s pra}, and
so on.

The other rules are more straightforward:

{ul
{li Rule 1.1.38 refers to various minor {s taddhita} suffixes, as used for words
like {s tatra} and {s tadA}.}

{li Rule 1.1.39 refers to various minor {s kRt} suffixes. The most common of these
is the suffix {s tumu~n}, as in {s gantum} ("to go").}

{li Rule 1.1.40 refers to the common suffix {s ktvA} and a few minor suffixes used
mainly in Vedic works.}

{li Rule 1.1.41 refers to the {s avyayIbhAva}, a type of compound.}
}


{h How do we derive an {s avyaya}?}

Since an {s avyaya} is a {s prAtipadika}, we first add a {s sup} affix. We then
immediately replace it with the {s luk} suffix by 2.4.82:

{rule

avyayAdApsupaH | 2.4.82
avyayAt Ap-supaH
After an `avyaya, `Ap and `sup [are replaced with `luk].

}

And {s luk} will then cause {s lopa} of the {s sup} affix:

{rule

adarzanaM lopaH | 1.1.60
a-darzanam lopaH
Disappearance is [called] `lopa.

pratyayasya lukzlulupaH | 1.1.61
pratyayasya luk-zlu-lupaH
`lopa of a `pratyaya by the words `luk, `zlu, and `lup is referred to by those
terms, respectively.

}
