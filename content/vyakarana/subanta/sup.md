{title {s sup-pratyAhAra}}

In the previous lesson, we learned about the {s prAtipadika}. By combining a {s
prAtipadika} with one of the {s sup} suffixes, we create a complete {s
subanta}.

In this lesson, we'll learn about the basic {s sup} endings.


{h {s adhikAra} rules}

The {s sup} endings are defined in the scope of three {s adhikAra} rules. The
first two are familiar:

{rule

pratyayaH | 3.1.1
_
&hellip; is a `pratyaya (suffix).

parazca | 3.1.2
paraH ca
&hellip; and [it is inserted] after [the base].

}

And the last is new:

{rule

GyApprAtipadikAt | 4.1.1
GI-Ap-prAtipadikAt
After [the suffixes] `GI or `Ap, or after a `prAtipadika (stem), &hellip;

}

{s GI} and {s Ap} are {s pratyaya}s that create feminine bases, and we can set
them aside for now.


{h {s sup-pratyAhAra}}

Here are the endings in the {s sup pratyAhAra}:

{rule

svaujasamauTchaSTAbhyAMbhisGebhyAMbhyasGasibhyAMbhyasGasosAmGyossup | 4.1.2
su~-au-jas-am-auT-zas-TA-bhyAm-bhis-Ge-bhyAm-bhyas-Gasi~-bhyAm-bhyas-Gas-os-Am-Gi-os-sup
`su~, `au, `jas, `am, `auT, `zas, `TA, `bhyAm, `bhis, `Ge, `bhyAm, `bhyas,
`Gasi~, `bhyAm, `bhyas, `Gas, `os, `Am, `Gi, `os, and `sup.

}

There are several points worth noticing here.

First, notice that many of these endings have {s it} sounds attached to
them:

{ul
    {li Some of these {s it} letters are for the sake of making {s pratyAhAra}s.
    Thus {s suT} refers to just the first five of these endings, and {s sup} (as we
    know already) refers to all of them.}

    {li Some are labeled systematically. For example, the {s Git} endings --
    that is, the endings with {s G} as an {s it} -- are often replaced,
    depending on the {s prAtipadika} and its gender.}

    {li Some of these {s it} letters are for the sake of easier pronunciation,
    or they have other miscellaneous functions. Thus we have {s su~}, {s
    Gasi~}, and the like.}
}

Second, notice that these endings are not the standard endings we would use for
a stem like {s rAma}. Pāṇini examined many different nominal ending patterns
and chose this set to represent what they have in common. Then we can apply
various {s vidhi} rules to get the endings we need, as we did for the {s tiG}
endings.

How do we choose which ending to use? In part, we can reuse these rules from
when we studied the {s tiG} endings:

{rule

tiGastrINi trINi prathamamadhyamottamAH | 1.4.101
tiGaH trINi trINi prathama-madhyama-uttamAH
Taken three by three, the `tiG [suffixes] are called `prathama (first),
`madhyama (middle), and `uttama (last).


tAnyekavacanadvivacanabahuvacanAnyekazaH | 1.4.102
tAni ekavacana-dvivacana-bahuvacanAni ekazaH
They [i.e. these triples] are called `ekavacana (singular), `dvivacana (dual),
and `bahuvacana (plural) when taken one by one.

supaH | 1.4.103
_
[`ekavacana, `dvicana, and `bahuvacana also apply for the triples] of `sup
(i.e. the nominal endings).

vibhaktizca | 1.4.104
vibhaktiH ca
And [these triples are each called] `vibhakti.

}

By choosing a specific {s vacana} (number), we narrow twenty-one endings down
to seven. That leaves us with a very important distinction to make:


{h {s vibhakti}}

The different {s sup vibhakti}s don't have any special names. They are simply
called {s prathamA} (first), {s dvitIyA} (second), and the like:

{ex

su au jas
(`prathamA)

am auT zas
(`dvitIyA)


}

How do we choose which {s vibhakti} to use? As you might guess, these {s
vibhakti}s imply different semantics. But the route we take from semantics to
a specific {s vibhakti} is an interesting one. The next two lessons will focus
on this process.
