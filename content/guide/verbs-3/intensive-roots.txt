{title Intensive roots}
{aka frequentative roots, {s yaGanta} ("ending in the affix {s yaG}")}


{dfn Intensive roots} show that an action was done in an intense or frequent
way:

{ex

lapati > [lAlapyate]
laments > repeatedly laments

}

With verbs of motion, the intensive implies crooked or difficult motion:

{ex

jaGgamyate
goes crookedly

}

And for certain roots, the intensive implies blameworthy or inept action:

{ex

lolupyate
cuts badly

}

Although intensive roots can be used with {s parasmaipada} endings, such forms
are very rare. Here, we will focus on the form used with {s Atmanepada}
endings.


{h Making the root}

Generally, roots that start with vowels and roots in the {s cur} class cannot
make intensive roots. But most other roots can.

To make the intensive root, we use a special kind of doubling. First, we add
the suffix {s -ya}, which causes the same changes as the {s karmaNi prayoga} {s
-ya} suffifx we used for the special tense-moods:

{ex

lup > lupya

}

Then, we double the root according to the normal rules:

{ex

lupya > lu lupya

}

Finally, we strengthen the double's vowel:

{ex

lu lupya > [lolupya]

}

Here are some other examples:

{ex

bhU > bobhUya
repeatedly be

kR > cekrIya
repeatedly do

}

And a common exception if {s R} is the middle vowel: 

{ex

sRp > sarIsRpya
repeatedly creep; creep along

vRt > varIvRtya
repeatedly turn

nRt > narInRtya
repeatedly dance

}


{h Using the root}

The intensive roots always use {s Atmanepada} endings:

{ex

jaGgamyate
goes crookedly

}

For the special tense-moods, we use these roots as if they were part of the {s
div} class:

{ex

narInRtyeta
might repeatedly dance

}

And for the distant past tense, we use the suffix {s -Am}:

{ex

lolupyAM cakre
(someone) cut badly (long ago)

}
