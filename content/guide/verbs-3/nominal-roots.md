{title Nominal roots}
{aka denominative verbs, {s nAmadhAtu} ("nominal roots")}

There are various suffixes that turn a nominal stem into a verb root. Here, we
will share the most common of these suffixes.

First is the suffix {s -i}. This suffix is the most common, and we use it in the
same way as the causal suffix {s -i}:


{ex

mizra > mizrayati
mixed > mixes

mUtra > mUtrayati
urine, pee > urinates, pees

vrata > vratayati
vow > observes a vow

}

Next is the suffix {s -ya}, which generally changes the stem's final {s a} to
{s I}. {s -ya} also usually lengthens the stem's final vowel:

{ex

putra > putrIyati
son > wants a son

kavi > kavIyati
poet > wants a poet

}

We might also consider the suffix {s -kAmya}:

{ex

putra > putrakAmyati
son > wants a son

yazas > yazaskAmyati
fame > wants fame

}
