{title Nominal roots}
{aka denominative verbs, {s nAmadhAtu} ("nominal roots")}

There are various suffixes that turn a nominal stem into a verb root. Here, we
will share some common suffixes.

First is the suffix {s ya}:

{ex

putra > putrIyati
son > wants a son

kavi > kavIyati
poet > wants a poet

}

Next is the suffix {s i}. This suffix is the most common, and we use it in the
same way as the causal suffix {s i}:


{ex

mizra > mizrayati
mixed > mixes

mUtra > mUtrayati
urine, pee > urinates, pees

vrata > vratayati
vow > observes a vow

}

And we might also consider the suffix {s kAmya}:

{ex

putra > putrakAmyati
son > wants a son

yazas > yazaskAmyati
fame > wants fame

}
