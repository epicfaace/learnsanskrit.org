{title Causal roots}
{aka causative roots, {s Nijanta} ("ending in the {s Nic} affix")}

In the core lessons, we learned that we can create new verb roots from existing
ones. These {dfn derived roots} modify the root's basic meaning in some way.
Once we have a derived root, we can use it the same way we would use any verb
root.

One of the most common derived roots is the {dfn causal root}. You can see some
examples of causal roots below:

{ex

nI > nAyi > nAyayati
lead > make lead > they make (someone) lead

car > cAri > cArayati
walk > make walk > they make (someone) walk

}

Some causal roots might also have a more idiomatic meaning:

{ex

gamayati
makes go; passes (time), leads (someone)

}


{h Making the root}

We make the causal root by adding {s -i} to the end of the original root.

Roots that end in vowels strengthen to the strongest level:

{ex

nI > nAyi
lead > make lead

bhU > bhAvi
become > make become

kR > kAri
do > make do

}

Other vowels often strengthen to {s e} or {s o}:

{ex

zuc > zoci
grieve > make grieve

}

Roots that end in {s -A} generally use an extra {s -p-} sound. Roots that end
in {s -e}, {s -ai}, or {s -o} have their final vowel changed to {s -A}:

{ex

sthA > sthApi
stand > make stand

gai > gApi
sing > make sing

dA > dApi
give > make give

}

And there are a few irregular changes:

{ex

gam > gami
go > make go

han > ghAti
kill, strike > make strike

}


{h Using the root}

We treat this root like a member of the {s bhU} class and can use either {s
parasmaipada} or {s Atmanepada} endings:

{ex

kAri > kArayati
make do > makes do

kAri > kArayiSyati
make do > will make do

kAri > kArayAM cakAra
make do > made do (long ago)

}
