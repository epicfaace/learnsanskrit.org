{title Desiderative roots}
{aka {s sannanta} ("ending in the {s san} affix")}

{note This lesson depends on material from {it Verbs 2}.}

{dfn Desiderative roots} have a complex name but express a simple idea. Simply,
they express the idea of {em wanting to} do something.

{ex

jigamiSAmi
I [want to] go.

}

A few roots create this derived root without any sense of "wanting". These
derived roots usually have special idiomatic meanings:

{ex

tij > titikSati
be sharp > endures

gup > jugupsati
protect > detests, despises

man > mImAMsati
think > investigates

}


{h Making the root}

We double the root and add {s -s} or {s -iS} depending on the root.

When we studied the distant past tense, we learned some of the basic rules of
doubling. The desideradive root follows similar rules but with a few small
changes.

First, the {s a} in the doubled root sound changes to {s i}:

{ex

sthA > tiSThAs
stand > want to stand

}

Roots ending in a short vowel use a long vowel:

{ex

stu > tuSTUs
praise > want to praise

zru > zuzrUS
hear > want to hear; attend or serve (idiomatic meaning)

}

Roots ending in {s -R} or {s -RR} generally change their final vowel to {s
-Ir}:

{ex

kR > cikIrS
do > want to do

tRR > titIrS
cross > want to cross

}

but use {s -Ur} if the vowel follows a "lip" consonant ({s pa}):

{ex

pRR > pupUrS
fill > want to fill

mR > mumUrS
die > "want to die"; be about to die

}

Here are some common irregular roots:

{ex

Ap > Ips
obtain > want to obtain

labh > lips
obtain > want to obtain

}


{h Using the root}

Desiderative roots generally use the same {s pada} as the original root:

{ex

labhase > lipsase
you obtain > you want to obtain

karomi > cikIrSAmi
I do > I want to do
(`parasmaipada)

kurve > cikIrSe
I do > I want to do
(`Atmanepada)

}

For the special tense-moods, we use this root as if it were part of the {s tud}
class:

{ex

cikIrSanti
they want to do

jigamiSet
(someone) might want to go

}

For the distant past tense, we use the suffix {s -Am}:

{ex

jigamiSAM cakAra
(someone) wanted to go (long ago)

}
