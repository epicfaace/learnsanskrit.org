{title The {s bahuvrIhi}}
{aka the possessive compound}

{s-dfn bahuvrIhi} literally means "(having) much rice." In a {s bahuvrIhi}
compound, the two compounded words describe an idea that is not explicitly
mentioned. Usually, the first word describes the second:

{ex

mahAn ratho [yasya] > mahArathaH
[who has] a great chariot > "great-charioted," a great warrior

pIto 'mbaro [yasya] > pItAmbaraH
[who has] yellow clothes > yellow-clothed

dRDhA vratA [yasya] > dRdhavrataH
[who holds] firm vows > firm-vowed

}

Or sometimes, the relationship is more complex:

{ex

cakraM pANau [yasya] > cakrapANiH
[in whose] hand is a discus > discus-handed

}

We have many examples of this compound in English: flatfoot, lowlife,
yellow-belly, blockhead, kindhearted, evil-minded, and so on.

Why do we describe this compound with a strange word like {s bahuvrIhi}? Part
of the reason is that the word "{s bahuvrIhi}" is itself a {s bahuvrIhi}
compound:

{ex

bahur vrIhir [yasya] > bahuvrIhi
[who has] much rice > "much-riced," a wealthy person

}


{h Using the {s bahuvrIhi}}

The {s bahuvrIhi} is an adjective, regardless of the genders used by its
individual words. For example, consider the example below:

{ex

sthitA prajJA [yasya] > sthitaprajJaH
[whose] discernment is stable > "stable-discernmented"

}

{s prajJA} is a feminine word, but {s sthitaprajJa} is an adjective that can be
used with masculine words. 


{h Ambiguous compounds}

The {s bahuvrIhi} often strongly resembles a {s tatpuruSa}:

{ex

dRDhavrataH
firm vow (`tatpuruSa interpretation)
whose vows are firm (`bahuvrIhi interpretation)

}

In older Sanskrit, {s bahuvrIhi} and {s tatpuruSa} compounds usually have
different accents. But in later Sanskrit, we must rely on context to tell these
compounds apart.


{h Review}

This lesson reminds us of a charming verse:

{ex

ahaM ca tvaM ca rAjendra [lokanAthAv] ubhAvapi |
Both I and you, O lord of men, are `loka-`nAtha_s (world-lords).

bahuvrIhirahaM rAjan SaSThItatpuruSo bhavAn ||
I am a `bahuvrIhi, my king, and you are a case 6 `tatpuruSa.

}

The speaker, due to his poverty, is someone whom the entire world dominates ({s
loko nAtho yasya}), and the king is an ordinary lord of the earth ({s lokasya
nAthaH}).
