{title The {s dvandva}}
{aka the coordinative compound}

{dfn {s dvandva}} literally means "pair." Any set of words that could be
combined with the word {s ca} ("and") can be combined into a {s dvandva}:

{ex

rAmaH sItA [ca] > rAmasIte
Rama [and] Sita

rAmaH sItA lakSmaNaH [ca] > rAmasItAlakSmaNAH
Rama, Sita, [and] Lakshmana

}

In the examples above, notice that the compound's {em number} matches the
combined numbers of its items. Thus {s rAma-sIte} is in the dual and {s
rAma-sItA-lakSmaNAH} is in the plural.

Also, notice that the compound usees the gender of its last item. Thus {s
rAma-sIte} uses a feminine ending and {s rAma-sItA-lakSmanAH} uses a masculine
ending.


{h Two types of {s dvandva}}

The {s dvandva} is a simple compound, but it has some small subtleties that are
worth knowing. In particular, it has two main subtypes.

The first is the type we saw above, where several different items are listed
together. This is called the {s-dfn itaretara-dvandva} ("one-and-another {s
dvandva}"):

{ex

rAmaH sItA lakSmaNaH [ca] > rAmasItAlakSmaNAH
Rama, Sita, [and] Lakshmana

phalAni puSpANi [ca] > phalapuSpANi
fruits and flowers

}

But if all of the members imply some more complete collection of concepts, we
have a second type called {s-dfn samAhAra-dvandva} ("collection {s dvandva}").
The {s samAhAra-dvandva} is always in the neuter singular:

{ex

AhAra-nidrA-bhayam
food, sleep, and fear

pANi-pAdam
hands and feet

}

Here, the compound {s AhAranidrAbhayam} refers not just to food, sleep, and
fear, but to all of the characteristics of animal life more broadly. Likewise,
the compound {s pANipAdam} refers not just to hands and feet but to all the
limbs of the body.


{h Other small changes}

For a few {s dvandva}s, the individual words might undergo some small changes.
Here are some common examples:

{ex

mAtA pitA ca > [mAtA]pitarau
mother and father

mitro varuNaH ca > [mitrA]varuNau
Mitra and Varuna (names of Vedic gods)

dyauH pRthivI ca > [dyAvA]pRthivI
heaven and earth

}
