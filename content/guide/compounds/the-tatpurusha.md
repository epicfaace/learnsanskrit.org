{title The {s tatpuruSa}}
{aka the determinative compound}

{dfn {s tatpuruSa}} literally means "his man" or "his servant." In a {s
tatpuruSa} compound, the second word is the main idea and the first word
describes it in some way:

{ex

dharmasya [kSetram] > dharmakSetram
[field] of dharma > dharma field

kurUNAM [kSetram] > kurukSetram
[field] of the Kuru people > Kuru field

}

Why do we describe this compound with a strange word like {s tatpuruSa}? Part
of the reason is that the word "{s tatpuruSa}" is itself a {s tatpuruSa}
compound:

{ex

tasya puruSaH > tatpuruSa
his man

}

The {s tatpuruSa} is common and has many different varieties. So it is worth
knowing well.

}


{h {s upapada} compounds}

upapada} is a word that we can create only when making a compound. Here is a
