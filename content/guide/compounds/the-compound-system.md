{title The compound system}

{dfn Compounds} {sa-opt samAsa} are combinations of multiple words. Usually, we
combine two words at a time:

{ex

rAmasya mAtA > rAmamAtA
Rama's mother

}

We can even combine compounds with other words to make new compounds:

{ex

rAmamAtur gRham > rAmamAtRgRham
Rama's mother's house

}

And we can repeat this process again and again. Some styles of Sanskrit
literature use {em very} long compounds.

Compared to using separate words, compounds are ambiguous and lose information:

{ex

gajasya phalam > gajaphalam
The elephant's fruit > elephant fruit

gajAnAM phalam > gajaphalam
The elephants' fruit > elephant fruit

}

But although compounds lose information, compounds are compact and short. If
the context is clear, they save a lot of time. And if a sentence is very
complex, compounds can even make the sentence clearer and easier to follow.

For this reason, compounds are common in Sanskrit, especially in later
compositions.


{h Four types of compounds}

Sanskrit compounds have four basic types. Each of the next four lessons will
examine one of these types in more detail.

First is the {s-dfn dvandva}, which we saw in our series of core lessons. Any
set of words that could be combined with the word "and" can be combined into a
{s dvandva}:

{ex

rAmaH sItA [ca] > rAmasIte
Rama and Sita

rAmaH sItA lakSmaNaH [ca] > rAmasItAlakSmaNAH
Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana

}

Second is the {s-dfn tatpuruSa}, which we also saw in our series of core
lessons. The idea is that the first word modifies the second in some way, just
as a chessboard is a type of board (and not a type of chess):

{ex

rAmasya [mAtA] > rAmamAtA
Rama's [mother]

rAmasya [putraH] > rAmaputraH
Rama's [son]

}

Third is the {s-dfn bahuvrIhi}. This is similar to English examples like
"graybeard" (a person whose beard is gray) and "blockhead" (a person with a
block-like head). The idea is that both words, together, describe someone who
is not explicitly mentioned in the compound:

{ex

mahAn rathaH [yasya] > mahArathaH
[whose] chariot is great > "great-charioted," a great warrior

sthitA prajJA [yasya] > sthitaprajJaH
[whose] discernment is stable > "stable-discernmented"

}

Fourth is the {s-dfn avyayIbhAva}. This creates uninflected words. Usually,
the first word is itself an uninflected word:

{ex

[upa] + kRSNa > upakRSNam
[near] + Krishna > near Krishna

[yathA] + ukta > yathoktam
[according to] + said > as it was said

}


{h How to tell compounds apart}

Each of the compounds above has exactly two words. So how can we tell them
apart?  As you read more Sanskrit, you will be able to do so instinctively. But
until then, here are some basic tips.

The words in a {s dvandva} compounds are usually all of the same "type":
all people, all animals, all kinds of weapons, and the like:

{ex

rAmaH sItA lakSmaNaH ca > rAmasItAlakSmaNAH
Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana (all people)

}


The first word of an {s avyayIbhAva} is usually an uninflected word:

{ex

[yathA]zakti
[According to] one's power

}


The {s bahuvrIhi} and the {s tatpuruSa} are sometimes difficult to tell apart.
But a {s bahuvrIhi} is an adjective. For example, a {s bahuvrIhi} might
describe a {em masculine} noun, but its second word might come from a {em
feminine} noun. This happens in the example below:

{ex

sthitA pra[jJA] yasya > sthitapra[jJaH]
whose discernment is stable > "stable-discernmented"

}

When you see this mismatch, then you know that the compound is a {s
bahuvrIhi}.

Otherwise, notice what other words the compound {em agrees} with -- that is,
what other words it matches in gender, case, and number. For example, consider
the compound in the sentence below:
{ex

dRDha-vrato rAmo gacchati.
Firm-vow Rama goes.

}

Here, the compound {s dRDha-vrataH} has two interpretations:

{ul
    {li Rama, who is a firm vow, goes. ({s tatpuruSa})}
    {li Rama, who is firm-vowed, goes. ({s bahuvrIhi})}
}

But only the {s bahuvrIhi} option makes sense here.

{aside

{h The {s bahuvrIhi} in older Sanskrit}

In older Sanskrit, the {s bahuvrIhi} and the {s tatpuruSa} have different
accent patterns, so they are much easier to tell apart. Sadly, these accent
patterns are not made clear in later Sanskrit.
