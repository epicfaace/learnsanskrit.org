{title The conditional mood} 
{aka {s saMketaH} ("condition"), {s lRG}}

The {dfn conditional mood} describes situations that {em would} happen or {em
would have} happened.  In other words, it is used for hypothetical situations.
Here is a classic example:

{ex

dakSiNena ced [AyAsyan] na zakaTaM [paryAbhaviSyat]
If he [would come] by the southern road, the cart [would not overturn].

}

To form the conditional, we start with the stem from the simple future:

{ex

nI > neSya
lead > will lead

}

Then we use this stem as if we were using the ordinary past tense:

{ex

[aneSyat]
would lead, would have led

}

You can compare the conditional and the ordinary past in teh examples below.
In each example, the right side has two results. The first result uses the
ordinary past and the second uses the conditional:


{ex

nI > anayat, [aneSyat]
lead > led, [would do]

kR > akarot, [akariSyat]
do > did, [would do]
(`parasmaipada)

kR > akuruta, [akariSyata]
do > did, [would do]
(`Atmanepada)

}

The conditional mood is rare. So why are we studying it now? We are studying it
now because it is so similar to the tense-moods we have studied already.
