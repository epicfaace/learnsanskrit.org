{title The distant future tense}
{aka the periphrastic future, the first future, {s anadyanate bhaviSyan}
("future not of today"), {s luT}}

The {dfn distant future tense} traditionally refers to future actions that will
not happen soon. In Sanskrit, it is called {s an-adyatana} ("not of today").
Here is an example of the distant future tense:

{ex

rAmo [netA].
Rama will (eventually) lead.

}

Compared to the simple future tense, the distant future tense describes events
that are further away. It also has a more definite sense than the simple
future:

{ex

rAmo netA.
Rama will (surely and eventually) lead.

}

Since {s netA} is also a nominal word that means "leader," we can also
interpret this sentence in a different way:


{ex

rAmo netA.
Rama is a leader.

}

We can decide on the correct interpretation by considering the context of
the sentence.


{h Making the stem}

We form the stem by strengthening the root and adding the suffix {s -tA}:


{ex

nI > netA
lead > will lead

}

As usual, some roots will use {s iT}:

{ex

vand > vanditA

}


Since {s -tA} starts with a consonant, many sandhi changes might occur:

{ex

budh > boddhA
awaken > will awaken

dRz > draSTA
see > will see

}


{h Adding endings}

Here are the endings we use with {s parasmaipada} roots:

{verb

netA netArau netAraH
netAsi netAsthaH netAstha
netAsmi netAsvaH netAsmaH

}

If you have read some of our lessons on nominals, you might recognize the forms
we use here in the third person. {s netA}, {s netArau}, and {s netAraH} are the
masculine case 1 forms of the stem {s netR} ("leader"). The distant future is a
combination of this stem and the forms of the root {s as} ("be," "exist"):

{ex

netA + asi > netAsi

netA + asmi > netAsmi

}

Here are the endings we use with {s Atmanepada} roots:

{verb

netA netArau netAraH
netAse netAsAthe netAdhve
netAhe netAsvahe netAsmahe

}
