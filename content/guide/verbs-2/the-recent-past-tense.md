{title The recent past tense}
{aka the aorist, {s bhUta} ("past"), {s luG}}

Traditionally, the {dfn recent past tense} refers to any past action regardless
of time period:

{ex

azrauSam
I heard.

}

But recall that Sanskrit has three past tenses. Since the ordinary past tense
traditionally refers to non-recent ({s anadyatana}, "not of today") events, and
since the distant past tense refers to distant ({s parokSa}, "unwitnessed")
events, only this tense can refer to very recent past events. That is why we
call it the {em recent} past tense.

The recent past tense often has the sense of having {em just} done something:

{ex

azrauSam
I have heard.

}

This tense is rare and complicated. Here, we will focus only on a few of its
common patterns.


{h Making the stem}

We make the stem of the recent past tense in many different patterns. Some
roots use certain patterns, and other roots use other patterns.

Some roots are completely unchanged:

{ex

bhU > abhUH
become > you have become

}

Others use a {s -a} vowel:

{ex

gam > agamaH
go > you have gone

}

A third group doubles in a special way:

{ex

naz > anInazat
perish, be destroyed > it has perished


}

A fourth group strengthens with the suffix {s siS}:

{ex

nam > anaMsiSam
bow > I have bowed

}

A fifth group uses {s sa}:

{ex

zru > azrauSam
hear > I have heard

}

And there are other minor patterns, too.


{h Adding endings}

Generally, these stems use the endings of the ordinary past tense.


{h The recent past tense withouth {s a-}}

Here is a common pattern worth knowing. We can use the forms of the recent past
tense with a word like {s mA} ("don't") to state commands:

{ex

mA [gamaH].
Don't go.

mA [bhaiSIH].
Don't fear.

}

This command doesn't have any "past" meaning. It is just an alternate way of
giving a command.
