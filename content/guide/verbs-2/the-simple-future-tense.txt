{title The simple future tense}
{aka the {s s} future, the second future, {s bhaviSyan} ("future"), {s lRT}}

The {dfn simple future tense} refers to events that have not yet occurred:

{ex

gam > [gamiSyAmi]
go > I will go.

}

We call this the {em simple} future tense because Sanskrit has another
tense-mood that refers specifically to {em distant} future events.


{h Making the stem}

To make the stem of the simple future tense, we strengthen the root's vowel and
add {s-dfn -sya} to the end of the root. Some roots don't use {s iT}:

{ex

nI > neSya
lead > will lead

}

and others do:

{ex

vand > vandiSya
venerate > will venerate

}

{note
In these examples, note that {s -sya} becomes {s -Sya} due to a sandhi rule.
{s s} becomes {s S} after most vowels and after {s r} and {s k} sounds. For
details, see our lessons on consonant sandhi.
}

We also add {s iT} if the root ends in {s R}:

{ex

kR > kariSya
do > will do

smR > smariSya
remember > will remember

}

And a few other roots use {s iT} here as well:

{ex

gam > gamiSya
go > will go

}

Since {s sya} starts with a consonant, it may cause many sandhi changes if the
root ends with a consonant. Here are some examples:

{ex

labh > lapsya
obtain > will obtain

budh > bhotsya
awaken > will awaken

dah > dhakSya
burn > will burn

}

Finally, there are several slightly irregular stems. Here are some common ones:

{ex

dRz > drakSya
see > will see

man > maMsya
think > will think

}


{h Adding endings}

We use the same ending and {s pada} as we would in the present tense. In the
examples below, the first result on the right is in the present tense, and the 
second is in the simple future tense:

{ex

gam > gaccha[ti], gamiSya[ti]
go > goes, will go

labh > labha[te], lapsya[te]
obtain > obtains, will obtain

kR > karo[ti], kariSya[ti]
do > does, will do

kR > kuru[te], kariSya[te]
do > does, will do

}
