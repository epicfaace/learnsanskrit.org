The {dfn blessing mood} usually expresses a blessing or prayer:

{ex

zubhaM [bhUyAt]
May there be welfare (to all).

}

Like the recent past tense, the blessing mood is rare.


{h Making the stem}

Roots that use {s parasmaipada} endings generally use the same {s -ya} stem
that we use in {s karmaNi} and {s bhAve prayoga} for the special tense-moods:

{ex

gam > [gamya] > gamyAt
go > go > may (someone) go

vac > [ucya] > ucyAt
speak > speak > may (someone) speak

}

But even though these forms use a similar stem, they have the sense of {s
kartari prayoga}.

For {s Atmanepada} endings, we strengthen the root but don't add any special
suffixes.


{h Adding endings}

Here are the ends we add for {s parasmaipada} roots:

{verb

    yAt yAtAm yAsuH
    yAH yAstam yAsta
    yAsam yAsva yAsma

}

These endings are similar to the ones we use for the potential mood. The
difference is that we add {s -yAs-} to the beginning of each ending.

Here is an example of how to use these endings:

{verb

    nIyAt nIyAtAm nIyAsuH
    nIyAH nIyAstam nIyAsta
    nIyAsam nIyAsva nIyAsma

}

The blessing mood is quite rare, and its {s Atmanepada} forms are even rarer.
Here are the {s Atmanepada} endings we use:

{verb

    sISTa sIyAstAm sIran
    sISThAH sIyAsthAm sIdhvam
    sIya sIvahi sImahi

}

Again, these endings are similar to the ones we use for the potential mood. The
difference is that we add {s -sIs-} to the beginning of each ending. This {s
-sIs} becomes {s -sI-} if the ending starts with a voiced sound.


Here is an example of how to use these endings:

{verb

    neSISTa neSIyAstAm neSIran
    neSISThAH neSIyAsthAm neSIdhvam
    neSIya neSIvahi neSImahi

}

Note that the first {s s} of these endings changed due to sandhi.
