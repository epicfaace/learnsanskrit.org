{title The distant past tense}
{aka the perfect, {s parokSe bhUta} ("remote past"), {s liT}}

The {dfn distant past tense} usually describes historical or legendary events:

{ex

nI > ninAya
lead > led (long ago)

}

Certain types of Sanskrit literature use the distant past tense often. For
example, the {cite Rāmāyaṇa} and the {cite Mahābhārata} both use the distant
past tense extensively.

The distant past tense uses many irregular forms. So in this lesson, we will
focus just on its most common patterns.

{h Strong and weak stems}

The distant past tense has two stems: a {dfn strong stem} and a {dfn weak
stem}. We use the strong stem with singular {s parasmaipada} endings:

{ex

ninI + a > ninAya
someone led (long ago, `parasmaipada)

}

And the weak stem with all other endings:

{ex

ninI + uH > ninyuH
they led (long ago, `parasmaipada)

ninI + ire > ninyire
they led (long ago, `Atmanepada)

}


{h Rules of doubling}
{aka {s dvitva}}

Generally, we make the stem of this tense-mood by doubling the root. Then we
apply some basic rules to simplify the {em first} copy of the root.

Although each of these rules is basic, there are quite a few of them. As usual,
we recommend that you don't waste time memorizing these rules. Instead, simply
get a feel for the kinds of changes that occur. As you read more Sanskrit, you
will naturally start to assimilate and internalize them.

When doubling, long vowels become short:

{ex

dA dA > dadA
give

nI nI > ninI
lead

}

Aspirated sounds become unaspirated:

{ex

dhA dhA > dadhA
place

}

All consonants after the double's vowel are removed:

{ex

budh budh > bubudh
awaken

as as > As
be, exist

}

And if a root starts in multiple consonants, only one of them is kept. We
usually keep the second consonant:

{ex

stu stu > tuSTu
praise

sthA sthA > tasthA
stand

}

But if the second consonant is nasal, we keep the first:

{ex

smR smR > sasmR
remember

}

Sounds pronounced at the soft palate ({s ka}) shift to the hard palate ({s
ca}):

{ex

gA gA > jagA
sing

}

{s R}, {s RR}, and {s L} become {s a}:

{ex

kR kR > cakR
do

tRR tRR > tatRR
cross

kLp > cakLp
be fit for

}

Roots that allow {s samprasAraNa} will use it:

{ex

vac vac > uvac
speak

yaj yaj > iyaj
sacrifice

vad vad > uvad
say

}

{note
For details on {s samprasAraNa}, see our lesson on {url[r=guide.lesson
topic=verbs-1 slug=karmani-and-bhave-prayoga] the special tenses in {s karmaNi}
and {s bhAve prayoga}}.
}

Finally, here is a common exception:

{ex

bhU > [ba]bhU
become

}

There are various other small rules. But these are the basic patterns. Rather
than memorize these changes, read over the examples above and get a basic
feeling for what kinds of sound changes occur.


{h Making the stem}

Roots with one vowel generally use the {em doubling} procedure we described
above:

{ex

kR > cakR
do

}

For the weak stem, some roots lose their vowel completely. Here are some common
examples:

{ex

jajan + e > jajJe
was born

jagam + uH > jagmuH
they went

}

Roots that allow {s samprasAraNa} will use it again:

{ex

uvac > u + [uc] > UcuH
the spoke

iyaj > i + [ij] > IjuH
they sacrificed

uvad > u + [ud] > UduH
they said

}

Under very specific conditions, we may also get this weak stem:

{ex

zak > zekuH
they were able

man > menire
they thought

}

The specific conditions are:

{ol
    {li The root vowel is {s a}.}
    {li {s a} has exactly one consonant on either side of it.}
    {li The doubled root starts with the same sound as the original root.}
}

To make these conditions clear, here are some examples of roots that violate
these conditions.  Since they violate these conditions, they use the normal
weak stem we described above:

{ex

zuc > zuzucuH
They grieved.
(violates condition 1 because the root vowel is not `a.)

nand > nananduH
They delighted.
(violates condition 2 because `a is followed by two consonants)

gaN > jagaNuH
They counted.
(violates condition 3 because the double does not start with `g.)

}


{h A special form for derived roots}

For derived roots and roots in the {s cur} class, we use a simple procedure.
First, we add {s -Am} to the root:

{ex

bodhi > bodhayAm
wake someone up

}

Then, we use this result with the roots {s kR}, {s bhU}, or {s as}:

{ex

bodhayAJcakAra
woke (someone) up

bodhayAmbabhUva
woke (someone) up

bodhayAmAsa
woke (someone) up

}

You might also see these results written as separate words:

{ex

bodhayAM cakAra
woke (someone) up

bodhayAM babhUva
woke (someone) up

bodhayAm Asa
woke (someone) up

}


{h Adding {s parasmaipada} endings}

The distant past tense uses special {s parasmaipada} endings:

{verb

a-s atus us
tha-s athus a
a-s va ma

}

If the {s parasmaipada} ending is singular, we use the strong stem. Otherwise,
we use the weak stem.

The {s -a} endings in the singular cause an unusual change. Roots that end in
vowels usually strengthen to the strongest level:

{ex

nI > ninAya
lead > led

kR > cakAra
do > did

}

And roots whose second to last sound is a vowel strengthen that vowel to {s e},
{s o}, or {s A}:

{ex

viz > viveza
enter > entered

zuc > zuzoca
grieve > grieved

has > jahAsa
laugh > laughed

}

The first-person singular {s a} has an optional form that uses a medium level
of strengthening:

{ex

kR > cakAra, cakara
do > I did (long ago)

}

To make these endings clear, here are the forms of the root {s kR}:

{verb

cakAra-s cakratus cakrus
cakartha-s cakrathus cakra
cakAra,cakara-s cakRva cakRma

}

But if the root ends in {s -A}, we use the ending {s -au} in the singular
instead of {s -a}. To make this clear, here are the forms of the root {s sthA}.
Note that {s sthA} also has an optional version in the second-person singular:

{verb

tasthau-s tasthatuH tasthuH
tasthAtha,tasthitha-s tasthathuH tastha
tasthau tasthiva tasthima

}


{h Adding {s Atmanepada} endings}

We generally use the standard {s Atmanepada} endings of the present tense. The
exceptions are the new endings {s e} and {s ire} in the third person:

{verb

e Ate ire
se Athe dhve
e vahe mahe

}

Again, here are the forms of the root {s kR}:

{verb

cakre cakrAte cakrire
cakRSe cakrAthe cakRDhve
cakre cakRvahe cakRmahe

}

Note the change from {s dhve} to {s Dhve}, which is common in the distant past
tense.


{h Review}

The distant past tense has many complicated patterns. The best way to get used
to it, as usual, is to read a lot of Sanskrit.

But if you are feeling overwhelmed by the number of details here, here are the
simple essentials you can remember and use:

{ol
    {li You can usually recognize this tense by its doubled sound. You don't
    need to remember the details of how the stem is formed or how the doubling
    is done, as long as you can recognize that {em something} has been
    doubled.}
    {li This tense is almost always used in the third person, and its singular
    and plural forms are by far the most common. You can ignore the other
    endings for now.}
    {li The context of the sentence will help make the meaning of the verb clear.}
}
