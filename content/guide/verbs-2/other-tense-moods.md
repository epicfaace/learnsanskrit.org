In the core lessons, we learned that we can change a verb {em root} into a
verb {em stem}. And once we have a verb stem, we can add endings to that
stem to create a complete {em verb}. In the examples below, note the
progression from root to stem to verb:

{ex

[nI] > neSya > neSyAmi
lead > will lead > I will lead

[nI] > ninI > ninyuH
lead > led (long ago) > they led (long ago)

}

We also learned that Sanskrit verbs express five basic kinds of information:
{em person}, {em number}, {em tense-mood}, {s prayoga}, and {s pada}.

Sanskrit uses ten different tense-moods. Four of these tense-moods use very
similar stems in {s kartari prayoga}, and the stem depends on which {em verb
class} a root belongs to:

{ex

nI > [naya] > nayati
(`bhU class)

su > [sunu] > sunoti
(`su class)

krI > [krINA] > krINAti
(`krI class)

}

But the other six tense-moods form their stems in a more general way. We apply
the same steps regardless of which verb class a root belongs to. For example,
consider the three verbs below. They each use verbs from different verb
classes, but they form their stems in an identical way:

{ex

nI > neSyati

su > soSyati

krI > kreSyati

}

In this topic, we will explore these six tense-moods.


{h Common behavior for the six tense-moods}

Recall that for the special tense-moods, we use a special stem in {s karmaNi
prayoga} and {s bhAve prayoga}. This special stem uses the suffix {s -ya}:

{ex

nayasi
You lead.
(`kartari `prayoga)

nIyase
You are led.
(`karmaNi `prayoga)

}

But for the other tense-moods, we just use {s Atmanepada} endings without using
a different stem:

{ex

neSyati.
You will lead.

neSyate.
You will be led.

}

Many verbs will also add an extra {s i} sound between the root and the ending.
In the examples below, notice that each verb has an extra {s i} sound:

{ex

bhU > bhaviSyasi (bhav-[i]-Syasi)
you will become

smR > smariSyasi (smar-[i]-Syasi)
you will remember

}

In traditional grammar, this {s i} is called {s-dfn iT}. Different roots use {s iT} in different ways:

{ul
    {li Some roots always use {s iT}, and they are called {s-dfn seT} ({s sa-iT}, "with {s iT}") roots.}
    {li Other roots don't use {s iT}, and they are called {s-dfn aniT} ({s an-iT}, "without {s iT}") roots.}
    {li A third group of roots uses {s iT} optionally, and they are called
    {s-dfn veT} ({s vA-iT}, "optional {s iT}") roots.}
}

Finally, roots that end in {s -e}, {s -ai}, or {s -au} will have their last
vowel change to {s -A}:

{ex

gai > [gA]syati
sing > will sing

}
