{title Devanagari}

{dfn Devanagari} ({d devanAgarI}) is a script that is used to write languages
like Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. In modern times, it is the script most
commonly used to write Sanskrit.

Here, we introduce the Devanagari script and show how it is used to write
Sanskrit. Throughout this page, we also offer some basic tips on how to learn
and practice it.


{h How Devanagari works}

Devanagari is written from left to right and closely follows how Sanskrit is
pronounced. If you hear a Sanskrit word, you will know exactly how to write it
in Devanagari. And if you see a word written in Devanagari, you will know
exactly how to pronounce it.

In the Latin script, one letter follows right after the other, from left to
right. But in Devanagari, symbols are usually grouped into syllables:

{ex

de va nA ga rI
Devanagari

saM skR ta m
Sanskrit

}

Each syllable has at most one vowel. And where possible, syllables should not
end with consonants.

By default, the symbols for consonants have the vowel sound {s a} pronounced after them:

{ex

da va na ga ra

sa ska ta ma

}

So to express the specific sounds we need, we must add extra marks to these
consonants:

{ex

da > [de]

na > [nA

ra > [rI]

sa > [saM]

ska > [skR]

ma > [m]

}

Also, notice that {s ska} ({d ska}) is a combination of two other consonant
symbols:

{ex

s + ka > ska

}

Sanskrit has many consonant clusters, so when we write Sanskrit in
Devanagari, we must use many different consonant combinations. For details, see
the section below.

Finally, the traditional practice when writing Sanskrit texts is to write words
continuously, especially if words end with consonants:

{ex

phalam icchAmi > phalamicchAmi

}

This is the basic idea of how Devanagari works.


{h Vowels}

When vowels do not follow consonants, they are written like this:

{sounds-dr a A i I u U}
{sounds-dr R RR L LL}
{sounds-dr e ai o au}

We include the long vowel {d LL} here for the sake of being complete, but it is 
never used in real Sanskrit.

In general, short and long vowels are written in a similar way: {d a} and {d
A}, {d i} and {d I}, {d u} and {d U}, {d R} and {d RR}, and {d L} and {d LL}.
This pattern also applies to {d e} and {d ai}, as well as {d o} and {d au}. In
each pair, notice that the second symbol adds some mark or extra feature to the
first.


{h Consonants}

When we write Sanskrit in Devanagari, all consonants are pronounced with the
vowel {s a} by default. So, the symbol {d ka} is always pronounced as {s ka},
never as {s k}.

{sounds-dr ka kha ga gha Ga}
{sounds-dr ca cha ja jha Ja}
{sounds-dr Ta Tha Da Dha Na}
{sounds-dr ta tha da dha na}
{sounds-dr pa pha ba bha ma}
{sounds-dr ya ra la va}
{sounds-dr za Sa sa ha}

We also have {s LLLa}, which is used only in Vedic Sanskrit:

{sounds-dr LLLa}

Some of these consonants are difficult to tell apart at first. Here are the
consonants that are most easily confused:

{ex

kha rava

gha dha

Ga Da

ca ja

Ta Tha Dha da

pa pha ya Sa

bha ma

va ba

}

As you start to learn these symbols, it may help to make mnemonics to keep them
distinct in your head. For example:

{ul
{li {d gha} is a "g" sound, and it looks like a {em gut} full of {em gas.}}
{li {d Ga} is a nasal sound, and its dot looks like a {em nose} ring.}
{li {d ca} is a "c" sound and looks like a {em chewing} mouth.}
{li {d ja} is a "j" sound and looks like a sharp {em javelin}.}
{li {d ba} and {d bha} are "b" sounds, and they look {em broken}.}
}

Of course, the mnemonics that stick best are the ones you think of yourself.


{h Vowels after consonants}

Vowels that follow consonants are written as small "marks" around the consonant
they follow:

{sounds-dr ka kA ki kI ku kU}
{sounds-dr kR kRR kL kLL}
{sounds-dr ke kai ko kau}

Again, we include the long vowel {d kLL} ({s kLL}) for the sake of being
complete, but it is never used in real Sanskrit.

The important point to remember here is that the vowel {s a} has no special
mark. {s a} is present by default. If needed, we can block that default {s a}
sound with a mark called the {s virAma}, which we discuss further below.

Most consonants use these marks in a regular way. But perhaps the three
combinations below will be surprising:

{sounds-dr ru rU rR}


{h {s anusvAra}, {s visarga}, {s candrabindu}, and {s virAma}}

The {s anusvAra} and {s visarga} are written as follows:

{sounds-dr kaM kaH}

The {dfn {s candrabindu}} ("moon dot") shows that a sound is pronounced
nasally. It is usually used for nasal vowels:

{sounds-dr ka~}

Finally, the {dfn {s virAma}} ("cessation") blocks the default {s a} sound that
a consonant would have otherwise:

{sounds-dr k}


{h Consonant clusters}

A {dfn consonant cluster} is a group of consecutive consonants with no vowel
sounds between them. Consonant clusters are common in Sanskrit, so they are
common when we write Sanskrit in Devanagari. You can learn to recognize most
consonant clusters with some practice.

First, we should note something important. Not all styles of Devanagari will
use all of these consonant clusters. And, the clusters you will see online
depend greatly on how well your computer supports these clusters.

Now, let's begin. First, here are the two clusters you absolutely must know.
Why? It's because these clusters do not resemble their original consonants at
all. For that reason, we cannot guess what sounds they represent; we must know
ahead of time. Here are the two clusters:

{sounds-dr kSa jJa}

Now, let's consider the other consonant cluster. Notice that most Devanagari
consonants have a single vertical line running from top to bottom. Usually,
this line is on the right side of the consonant:

{conjuncts ta Na sa}

In many consonant clusters, the first consonant loses this line and attaches to
the consonant that follows it:

{conjuncts tsa NDa sta}

If {s ra} is the first consonant, we simply add a small hook to the top of the
second:

{conjuncts rta rna rma}

If {s ra} is second, we add a small tick to the first consonant. For consonants
with a "hoop" shape (like {d Ta}, {d Tha}, {d Dha}, and {d da}), we use a
different symbol instead:

{conjuncts pra kra tra Tra Dhra}

If {s na} is second, we write it in the same way as {s ra}:

{conjuncts pna kna tna}

If {s ya} or {s ma} is second, it combines like this:

{conjuncts dya dma hya hma}

If {s za} is first, it combines like this:

{conjuncts zra zva zca zla}

If {s Sa} is first, it often stacks vertically on top of the consonants that
follow it:

{conjuncts STa STha SThva}

Voiced aspirated consonants that follow {s da} usually "dangle" off the bottom
of the {s da}:

{conjuncts dgha ddha dbha}

{s ta} combines in various ways that are hard to predict:

{conjuncts kta tta}

And if three or more consonants are in a cluster, we sometimes get more complex
combinations:

{conjuncts ttra stra}

{conjuncts Gkhya GkSya Gktya}

{conjuncts dghra ddhra dbhra}


{h Numerals}

The numerals that we use in the West originate in India. As a result, the
numerals we use in Devanagari are quite similar to the ones we use in English:

{sounds-dr 0 1 2 3 4}
{sounds-dr 5 6 7 8 9}

And they are used just like English numerals:

{ex

1947

2021

}


{h Punctuation}

Modern Sanskrit texts make use of various English punctuation marks, including
exclamation points (!), commas (,), and quotation marks ("").

But traditionally, Devanagari uses only a small set of punctuation marks. You
can see all of them below:

{sounds-dr | || '}

The first is called the {dfn {s daNDa}} ("stick"), which marks the end of a
sentence or the middle point of a verse:

{ex

rAmo gacchati.
Rama goes.

}

The second is sometimes called a double {s daNDa}, and it marks the end of a
paragraph or verse:

{ex

rAmo laGkAM gacchati. rAmo rAvaNaM hanti..
Rama goes to Lanka. Rama kills Ravana.

}

The last is called the {dfn {s avagraha}}, and it is sometimes used to show
that a vowel was removed due to a sound change rule:

{ex

zvetaH azvaH > zveto 'zvaH
white horse

te azvAH > te 'zvAH
They are horses.

}

An {s avagraha} may even be repeated if the vowel removed was long:

{ex

sA Aste > sA ''ste
She sits.

}


{h Accent}

When we write Vedic Sanskrit in Devanagari, we often use many {dfn accent
marks} to show how a vowel should be pronounced. Most commonly, we see just
three accents: {s-dfn udAtta}, {s-dfn anudAtta}, and {s-dfn svarita}.

In modern recitation, the {s anudAtta} is a low tone and the {s svarita} is a
high tone, with the {s udAtta} being between these two. Below, you can see how
{s anudAtta}, {s udAtta}, and {s svarita} are usually written down:

{conjuncts a_ a a^}

Note that {s udAtta} has no explicit mark and is assumed by default.


{h Old Devanagari}

Certain Devanagari letters have older versions that are no longer commonly
used. You can see these older versions below:

}
