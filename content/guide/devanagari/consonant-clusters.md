{title Consonant clusters}

A {dfn consonant cluster} is a group of consecutive consonants with no vowel
sounds between them. Consonant clusters are common in Sanskrit, so they are
common when we write Sanskrit in Devanagari.

{note
Not all styles of Devanagari will use all of these consonant clusters. And, the
clusters you will see online depend greatly on how well your computer supports
these clusters.

First, here are the two clusters you absolutely must know: 

{sounds-dr kSa jJa}

Why must we know these two clusters? These two clusters do not resemble their
original consonants at all, so we cannot guess what sounds they represent. That
is why we must learn them separately.

Now, let's consider the other consonant clusters. Notice that most Devanagari
consonants have a single vertical line running from top to bottom. Usually,
this line is on the right side of the consonant:

{conjuncts ta Na sa}

In many consonant clusters, the first consonant loses this line and attaches to
the consonant that follows it:

{conjuncts tsa NDa sta}

If {s ra} is the first consonant, we simply add a small hook to the top of the
second:

{conjuncts rta rna rma}

If {s ra} is second, we add a small tick to the first consonant:

{conjuncts pra kra tra}

But consonants with a "hoop" shape (like {d Ta}, {d Tha}, and {d Dha}) use a
different symbol instead:

{conjuncts Tra Thra Dhra}

If {s na} is second, we write it in the same way as {s ra}:

{conjuncts pna kna tna}

If {s ha} or {s da} is first and {s ya} or {s ma} is second, we get these
combinations:

{conjuncts dya dma hya hma}

If {s za} is first, it becomes a smaller form that sits on top of the second
consonant:

{conjuncts zra zva zca zla}

If {s Sa} is first, it often stacks vertically on top of the consonants that
follow it:

{conjuncts STa STha SThva}

Voiced aspirated consonants that follow {s da} usually "dangle" off the bottom
of the {s da}:

{conjuncts dgha ddha dbha}

{s ta} combines in various ways that are hard to predict:

{conjuncts kta tta}

And if three or more consonants are in a cluster, we sometimes get more complex
combinations:

{conjuncts ttra stra}

{conjuncts Gkhya GkSya Gktya}

{conjuncts dghra ddhra dbhra}
