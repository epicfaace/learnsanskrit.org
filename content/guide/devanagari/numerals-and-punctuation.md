{title Numerals and punctuation}


In this lesson, we will learn how to write numbers and various punctuation
marks in Devanagari. 


{h Numerals}

The numerals that we use in English originate in India. As a result, the
numerals we use in Devanagari are quite similar to the ones we use in English:

{sounds-dr 0 1 2 3 4}
{sounds-dr 5 6 7 8 9}

And they are used just like English numerals:

{ex

1947

2021

}


{h Punctuation}

Modern Sanskrit texts make use of various English punctuation marks, including
exclamation points (!), commas (,), and quotation marks ("").

But traditionally, Devanagari uses only a small set of punctuation marks. You
can see all of them below:

{sounds-dr | || '}

The first is called the {dfn {s daNDa}} ("stick"), which marks the end of a
sentence or the middle point of a verse:

{ex

rAmo gacchati.
Rama goes.

}

The second is sometimes called a double {s daNDa}, and it marks the end of a
paragraph or verse:

{ex

rAmo laGkAM gacchati. rAmo rAvaNaM hanti..
Rama goes to Lanka. Rama kills Ravana.

}

The last is called the {dfn {s avagraha}}, and it is sometimes used to show
that a vowel was removed due to a sound change rule:

{ex

zvetaH azvaH > zveto 'zvaH
white horse

te azvAH > te 'zvAH
They are horses.

}

An {s avagraha} may even be repeated if the vowel removed was long:

{ex

sA Aste > sA ''ste
She sits.

}
