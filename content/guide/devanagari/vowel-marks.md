{title Vowel marks}

Vowels that follow consonants are written as small "marks" around the consonant
they follow:

{ex

ka + A > kA

ka + u > kU

}

Here are the marks that we use when writing Sanskrit:


{sounds-dr ka kA ki kI ku kU}
{sounds-dr kR kRR kL kLL}
{sounds-dr ke kai ko kau}

Again, we include the long vowel {d kLL} ({s kLL}) for the sake of being
complete, but it is never used in real Sanskrit.

The important point to remember here is that the vowel {s a} has no special
mark. {s a} is present by default. If needed, we can block that default {s a}
sound with a mark called the {s virAma}, which we discuss further below.

Most consonants use these marks in a regular way. But perhaps the combinations
below will be surprising:

{sounds-dr ru rU rR}

{sounds-dr hR hRR}


{h {s anusvAra}, {s visarga}, {s candrabindu}, and {s virAma}}

The {s anusvAra} and {s visarga} are written as follows:

{sounds-dr kaM kaH}

The {dfn {s candrabindu}} ("moon dot") shows that a sound is pronounced
nasally. It is usually used for nasal vowels:

{sounds-dr ka~}

Finally, the {dfn {s virAma}} ("cessation") blocks the default {s a} sound that
a consonant has otherwise:

{sounds-dr k}
