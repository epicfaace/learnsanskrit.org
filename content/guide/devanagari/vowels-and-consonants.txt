{title Vowels and consonants}

In this lesson, we will learn how to write vowels and consonants in Devanagari.


{h Vowels}

When vowels do not follow consonants, they are written like this:

{sounds-dr a A i I u U}
{sounds-dr R RR L LL}
{sounds-dr e ai o au}

We include the long vowel {d LL} here for the sake of being complete, but it is 
never used in real Sanskrit.

In general, short and long vowels are written in a similar way. Notice the
similarities between {d a} and {d A}, {d i} and {d I}, {d u} and {d U}, {d R}
and {d RR}, and {d L} and {d LL}. This pattern also applies to {d e} and {d
ai}, as well as {d o} and {d au}. In each pair, notice that the second symbol
adds some mark or extra feature to the first.


{h Consonants}

When we write Sanskrit in Devanagari, all consonants are pronounced with the
vowel {s a} by default. So, the symbol {d ka} is always pronounced as {s ka},
never as {s k}.

{sounds-dr ka kha ga gha Ga}
{sounds-dr ca cha ja jha Ja}
{sounds-dr Ta Tha Da Dha Na}
{sounds-dr ta tha da dha na}
{sounds-dr pa pha ba bha ma}
{sounds-dr ya ra la va}
{sounds-dr za Sa sa ha}

Some of these consonants are difficult to tell apart at first. Here are the
consonants that are most easily confused:

{ex

kha rava

gha dha

Ga Da

ca ja

Ta Tha Dha da

pa pha ya Sa

bha ma

va ba

}

As you learn these symbols, it may help to make mnemonics to keep them distinct
in your head. For example:

{ul
{li {d gha} is a "g" sound, and it looks like a {em gut} full of {em gas.}}
{li {d Ga} is a nasal sound, and its dot looks like a {em nose} ring.}
{li {d ca} is a "c" sound and looks like a {em chewing} mouth.}
{li {d ja} is a "j" sound and looks like a sharp {em javelin}.}
{li {d ba} and {d bha} are "b" sounds, and they look {em broken}.}
}

Of course, the mnemonics that stick best are the ones you think of yourself.
