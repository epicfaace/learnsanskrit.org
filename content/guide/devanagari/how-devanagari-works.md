{title How Devanagari works}

{note If you can read Hindi, please see our note at the bottom.}

{dfn Devanagari} ({d devanAgarI}) is a script that is used to write languages
like Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. In modern times, it is the script most
commonly used to write Sanskrit.

Devanagari is written from left to right and closely follows how Sanskrit is
pronounced. If you hear a Sanskrit word, you will know exactly how to write it
in Devanagari. And if you see a word written in Devanagari, you will know
exactly how to pronounce it.

In the Latin script, one letter follows right after the other, from left to
right. But in Devanagari, symbols are usually grouped into syllables:

{ex

de va nA ga rI
Devanagari

saM skR ta m
Sanskrit

}

Each syllable has at most one vowel. And where possible, syllables should not
end with consonants.

By default, the symbols for consonants have the vowel sound {s a} pronounced after them:

{ex

da va na ga ra

sa ska ta ma

}

So to express the specific sounds we need, we must add extra marks to these
consonants:

{ex

da > [de]

na > [nA

ra > [rI]

sa > [saM]

ska > [skR]

ma > [m]

}

Also, notice that {s ska} ({d ska}) is a combination of two other consonant
symbols:

{ex

s + ka > ska

}

Sanskrit has many consonant clusters, so when we write Sanskrit in
Devanagari, we must use many different consonant combinations. For details, see
the section below.

Finally, the traditional practice when writing Sanskrit texts is to write words
continuously, especially if words end with consonants:

{ex

phalam icchAmi > phalamicchAmi

}

This is the basic idea of how Devanagari works.

{aside

{h Devanagari for Hindi speakers}

In Sanskrit, {d ka} is always pronounced as {s ka}, {strong never} as {s k}.
Likewise for all consonant sounds. So, words like {d rAma}, {d arjuna}, and {d
yoga} are pronounced as {s rAma}, {s arjuna}, and {s yoga}, {strong never} as
{s rAm} or {s arjun} or {s yog}.

Sanskrit uses many consonant clusters that don't often appear in Hindi. So even
if you are comfortable reading Devanagari already, please see our lesson on
consonant clusters.
