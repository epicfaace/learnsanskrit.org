{title Vedic Devanagari}


In this lesson, we have a few small notes on writing Vedic Sanskrit with
Devanagari.

{h {s LLLa} and {s LLLha}}

In some styles of Vedic recitation, the consonants {s Da} and {s Dha} become {s
LLLa} and {s LLLha} respectively. Here is how to write these two sounds in
Devanagari:

{sounds-dr LLLa LLLha}


{h Accent}

When we write Vedic Sanskrit in Devanagari, we often use many {dfn accent
marks} to show how a vowel should be pronounced. Most commonly, we see just
three accents: {s-dfn anudAtta}, {s-dfn udAtta}, and {s-dfn svarita}.

In modern recitation, the {s anudAtta} is usually a low tone and the {s
svarita} is usually a high tone. The {s udAtta} is usually a middle tone that
exists between these two. Here is how the {s anudAtta}, {s udAtta}, and {s
svarita} are usually written:

{conjuncts a_ a a^}

Note that {s udAtta} has no explicit mark and is assumed by default.
