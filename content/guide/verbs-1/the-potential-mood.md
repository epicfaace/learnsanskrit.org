{title The potential mood}
{aka the optative, {s vidhiH} ("injunction"), {s vidhiliG}}

The {dfn potential mood} is the last of the four special tense-moods.


{h Basic meaning}

The potential mood usually describes what might, could, or should happen:

{ex

rAmaH vanam [gacchet].
Rama [might go] to the forest.

}

The potential mood can express many different meanings based on the context.
For example, it can show what someone is capable of doing:

{ex

aham idaM vanaM sarvaM [daheyam].
I [could burn] all of this forest.

}

It can be a soft command:

{ex

tvam idaM [khAdeH].
You [should eat] this.

}

And there are other subtle uses as well.


{h Endings}

The endings we use with the potential mood are almost identical to the endings
of the ordinary past tense. There are two main differences. The first
difference is that we add an extra {s -I} sound before every ending:

{verb
    It ItAm IyuH
    IH Itam Ita
    Iyam Iva Ima
}

And the second is that the third-person plural ending is {s -uH} instead of {s
-an}:

{ex

anayan.
They led.

nayeyuH.
They might lead.

}

Here is how these endings appear when used with a stem like {s naya}:

{verb
    nayet nayetAm nayeyuH
    nayeH nayetam nayeta
    nayeyam nayeva nayema
}

Note the sandhi between the stem and the ending here:

{ex

naya + It > nayet
(someone) might, could, or should lead

}
