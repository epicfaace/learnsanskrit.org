{title The verb system}

{dfn Verbs} {sa-opt kriyAH "actions"} are highly expressive words that convey
many different types of information. In this lesson, we will learn about the
six types of information that Sanskrit verb endings express. Here are the six
types, for your reference:

{ul
    {li person and number}
    {li tense and mood}
    {li {s prayoga} and {s pada}}
}

Let's make our discussion concrete and focus on just a single verb root: the
root {s kR}. By seeing how this root can change and grow, we can get a better
sense of how Sanskrit verbs work.

{note
Don't focus on remembering every detail. Just focus on the larger picture.
}

{h Basic and derived roots}

There is a standard list of around 2,000 verb roots {sa-opt dhAtu "element"}.
All of these roots are quite short. Most have just one vowel sound:

{ex

kR
do, make

}

In addition to this list of basic roots, we can also create {dfn derived
roots}. We can create derived roots from existing roots:

{ex

kR > kAri
do, make > cause (someone) to do or make

}

And we can also create derived roots from nominal stems:

{ex

putra > putrIya
son > want a son

}

Once we have decided on our verb root, we can combine it with various suffixes
to express different kinds of information. More specifically, we can express
the six types of information we mentioned above:

{ul
    {li person and number}
    {li tense and mood}
    {li {s prayoga} and {s pada}}
}


{h Person and number}

{comm TODO: bug with sa-opt when wrapped with en first token on newline}

First, a verb can express {dfn person} or {dfn number}. We learned about both
of these during the core lessons.

As a reminder, Sanskrit verbs use three persons. In the traditional order,
these are the {dfn third person}:

{ex

karoti
(Someone) does.

}

the {dfn second person}:

{ex

karoSi
You do.

}

and the {dfn first person}:

{ex

karomi
I do.

}

Sanskrit verbs also use three numbers: the {dfn singular} for one item:

{ex

karoti
(Someone) does.

}

the {dfn dual} for exactly two items:

{ex

kurutaH
The two of them do.

}

and the {dfn plural} for three or more items:

{ex

kurvanti
They do.

}

{h Tense and mood}

Second, a verb can express different time periods (called {dfn tenses}) and
different modifications of the action (called {dfn moods}).

Sanskrit has ten common tense-mood combinations. Six of them refer to time
periods. We will call these six the {dfn present}:

{ex

karoti
(Someone) does.

}

the {dfn ordinary past}:

{ex

akarot
(Someone) did.

}

the {dfn recent past}:

{ex

akArSIt
(Someone) recently did.

}

the {dfn distant past}:

{ex

cakAra
(Someone) did long ago.

}

the {dfn near future}:

{ex

kariSyati
(Someone) will do.

}

and the {dfn distant future}:

{ex

kartA
(Someone) will eventually do.

}

The other four tense-mood combinations have more subtle meanings. We will call
these the {dfn command mood}:

{ex

kuru!
Do!

}

the {dfn potential mood}:

{ex

kuryAt
(Someone) might or could do.

}

the {dfn blessing mood}:

{ex

kriyAt
May (someone) do.

}

and the {dfn conditional mood}:

{ex

akariSyat
(Someone) would have done.

}

{h {s prayoga} and {s pada}}

Finally, a verb can express {s prayoga} and something called {s-dfn pada}.

{s prayoga} is similar to what we call "active voice" and "passive voice" in
English.  In Sanskrit, we have three prayogas. They are {s-dfn kartari
prayoga} ("agent usage"), which is like the English active voice:

{ex

naraH karma karoti.
The man does work.

naraH svapiti.
The man sleeps.

}

{s-dfn karmaNi prayoga} ("object usage"), which is like the English passive
voice:

{ex

nareNa karma [kriyate].
Work [is being done] by the man.

}

and {s-dfn bhAve prayoga} ("stative usage"), which is used by verbs that don't
use an object:

{ex

nareNa [supyate].
[There is sleeping] by the man. (The man sleeps.)

}

{s pada} is hard to describe in a simple way. Sanskrit verb endings are of two
different kinds, called {s-dfn parasmaipada} ("word for another") and {s-dfn
Atmanepada} ("word for oneself"). In older Sanskrit, different {s pada}s tend
to show whether an action is self-interested or mutual in some way:

{ex

sa karma karoti.
He does work [(for someone else)].

sa karma kurute.
He does work [(for himself)].

mA vidviSAva.
May we not quarrel [(with others)].

mA vidviSAvahai.
May we not quarrel [(with each other)].

}

But in later Sanskrit, {s pada} is not very meaningful:

{ul
    {li In {s kartari prayoga}, some roots use {s parasmaipada} and some roots
    use {s Atmanepada}. There is usually no deeper meaning being conveyed. It
    is like a noun's gender: some nouns use one gender, and some use another,
    even if that gender doesn't have a clear relationship to what the noun
    means.}
    {li In {s karmaNi prayoga} and {s bhAve prayoga}, all verbs use {s
    Atmanepada} endings.}
}


{h Other names for these concepts}

Our guide uses simple terms that are easy to understand. Outside our guide, you
might see other terms used. Here are the normal terms for person and number:

{table
{tr {th Our name} {th English name} {th Sanskrit name}}
{tr {td third person} {td (the same)} {td {s prathama-puruSaH} {br} ("first person")}}
{tr {td second person} {td (the same)} {td {s madhyama-puruSaH} {br} ("middle person")}}
{tr {td first person} {td (the same)} {td {s uttama-puruSaH} {br} ("last person")}}
{tr {td singular} {td (the same)} {td {s eka-vacanam} {br} ("singular")}}
{tr {td dual} {td (the same)} {td {s dvi-vacanam} {br} ("dual")}}
{tr {td plural} {td (the same)} {td {s bahu-vacanam} {br} ("plural")}}
}

And for the different tense-moods:

{table
{tr {th Our name} {th English name} {th Sanskrit name}}
{tr {td present} {td present indicative} {td {s vartamAnaH} {br} ("occuring")}}
{tr {td ordinary past} {td imperfect} {td {s anadyatana-bhUtaH} {br} ("non-near past")}}
{tr {td recent past} {td aorist} {td {s bhUta} {br} ("past")}}
{tr {td distant past} {td perfect} {td {s parokSa-bhUtaH} {br} ("remote past")}}
{tr {td near future} {td simple future} {td {s bhaviSyan} {br} ("future")}}
{tr {td distant future} {td periphrastic future} {td {s anadyatana-bhaviSyan} {br} ("non-near future")}}
{tr {td command} {td imperative} {td {s AjJA} {br} ("command")}}
{tr {td potential} {td optative} {td {s vidhiH} {br} ("injunction")}}
{tr {td blessing} {td benedictive} {td {s AzIH} {br} ("wish," "blessing")}}
{tr {td conditional} {td conditional} {td {s saMketaH} {br} ("condition")}}
}


{h Review}

The Sanskrit verb system is complex, and it has a lot of subtle qualities. The
following lessons will examine the verb system slowly and make these subtle
qualities clear.

For now, here are some basic questions to review:

{ol
    {li What are the three persons and numbers?}
    {li How many tense-mood combinations are there? Give an example of a
    tense-mood.}
    {li What are the three {s prayoga}s? What do they each mean?}
}
