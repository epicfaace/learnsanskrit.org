{title The {s su}, {s tan}, and {s krI} classes}


In the previous lesson, we learned about the four {em simple verb classes}:

{table
    {tr {th Root} {th Stem}}
    {tr {td {s-dr bhU}} {td {s-dr bhava}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr div}} {td {s-dr dIvya}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tud}} {td {s-dr tud}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr cur}} {td {s-dr coraya}}}
}

The other six verb classes are more complex. Let's call these six classes the
{dfn complex verb classes} for short.

In this lesson, we will study three of these classes: the {s su} class, the {s
tan} class, and the {s krI} class. First, we will learn how these classes form
their stems. Then, we will learn how to use these stems with the endings of the
four special tense-moods.

{h What makes a verb class complex?}

Why are these classes called the {em complex} verb class? First, their stems
end in sounds other than {s -a}. As a result, we might have to apply various
sandhi changes to these stems and endings:

{ex

dveS + ti > dveSTi
hate > (someone) hates

}

Second, their stems come in two different versions: a {dfn strong} stem that is
used with certain endings, and a {dfn weak} ending that is used with the other
endings:

{ex

[dveS] + ti > dveSTi
hate > (someone) hates
(strong stem)

[dviS] + anti > dviSanti
hate > (someone) hates
(weak stem)

}

Third, some of these classes use endings that differ from the endings we have
seen already:

{ex

kR > kurvate
They all make.
(Note that this is not *`kurvante, as we might otherwise expect)

}


{h The {s su} class}

The {dfn {s su} class} uses two different stems. Its strong stem uses the
suffix {s -no}, and its weak stem uses the suffix {s -nu}:

{ex

su > sunoti
(Someone) presses out.

su > sunvanti
They press out.

}

One of its important irregular verbs is {s zru} ("hear"). Its strong stem is
{s zRNo}, and its weak stem is {s zRNu}:

{ex

zru > zRNoti
(Someone) hears.

zru > zRNvanti
They hear.

}


{h The {s tan} class}

The {dfn {s tan} class} is just like the {s su} class. But instead of using {s
-no} and {s -nu}, it uses {s -o} and {s -u}:

{ex

tan > [tanoti]
expand > (someone) expands

tan > tanvanti
expand > they expand

}

The {s tan} class contains only ten roots. But it also contains the root {s
kR} ("do, make"), which is one of the most common roots in all of Sanskrit. The
strong stem of {s kR} is {s karo-}, and the weak stem is {s kuru-}:

{ex

kR > [karoti]
do > (someone) does

kR > kurvanti
do > they do

}


{h The {s krI} class}

The {dfn {s krI} class} uses {s -nA} for its strong stem and {s -nI} for its
weak stem:

{ex

krI > krINAti
buy > (someone) buys

krI > krINItaH
buy > the two of them buy

}

{s krI + nA} becomes {s krINA} due to a sandhi rule. The idea is that {s r}
might cause the {s n} sounds that follow it to become {s N}. 


{h Complex classes with {s parasmaipada} endings}

The complex classes use the same {s parasmaipada} endings as the simple
classes. In the tables below, the red words use a strong stem.

First, we have the present tense:

{verb
    sunoti-s sunutaH sunvanti
    sunoSi-s sunuthaH sunutha
    sunomi-s sunuvaH sunumaH
}

Notice the sandhi change in the second-person singular ({s sunosi} becomes {s
sunoSi}).

Next, we have the command mood:

{verb
    sunotu-s sunutAm sunvantu
    sunu sunutam sunuta
    sunavAni-s sunavAva-s sunavAma-s
}

Then the ordinary past tense:

{verb
    asunot-s asunutAm asunvan
    asunoH-s asunutam asunuta
    asunavam-s asunuva asunuma
}

And the potential mood:

{verb
    sunuyAt sunuyAtAm sunuyuH
    sunuyAH sunuyAtam sunuyAta
    sunuyAm sunuyAva sunuyAma
}

Notice that the ending uses {s -yA-} instead of {s -I-}. But the 3rd person
plural ending is just {s -yuH}.


{h Complex classes with {s Atmanepada} endings}

The complex classes generally use the same {s Atmanepada} endings as the simple
classes. The major difference is the third-person plural. Although we use {s
-ante} and {s -anta} in the simple classes, we use {s -ate} and {s -ata} here:

{ex

labhante
They obtain.

sunvate
They press out.

alabhanta
They obtained.

asunvata
They pressed out.

}

First, we have the present tense:

{verb
    sunute sunvAte sunvate
    sunuSe sunvAthe sunudhve
    sunve sunuvahe sunumahe
}

For the first person, we also have the optional forms {s sunvahe} and {s
sunmahe}.

Next is the command mood:

{verb
    sunutAm sunvAtAm sunvatAm
    sunuSva sunvAthAm sunudhvam
    sunavai-s sunavAvahai-s sunavAmahai-s
}

Then the ordinary past tense:

{verb
    asunuta asunvAtAm asunvata
    asunuthAH asunvAthAm asunudhvam
    asunvi asunuvahi asunumahi
}

Here, too, we have the optional forms {s asunvahi} and {s asunmahi} in the
first person.

Finally, we have the potential mood:

{verb
    sunvIta sunvIyAtAm sunvIran
    sunvIthAH sunvIyAthAm sunvIdhvam
    sunvIya sunvIvahi sunvImahi
}

Notice that most of these endings start with {s -I-}.

{h Endings for the {s tan} and {s krI} classes}

The {s tan} class is essentially identical to the {s su} class, including its
optional forms.

The {s krI} class also uses the same endings. But the last {s -I} of its weak
stem uses a special sandhi rule: if the verb ending starts with {s a}, then
the {s -I} is removed:

{ex

krINI + anti > [krINanti]

krINI + antu > [krINantu]

akrINI + an > [akrINan]

krINI + ate > [krINate]

akrINI + ata > [akrINata]

}

Also, the second-person singular of the command mood uses the ending {s -hi}:

{ex

etat [krINIhi].
[Buy] this.

}
