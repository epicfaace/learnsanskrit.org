{title {s Atmanepada}}
{aka the middle voice}

In the previous lesson, we focused on the {s parasmaipada} endings used by
the four special tense-moods. In this lesson, we will focus on the {s
Atmanepada} endings.


{h What is {s Atmanepada}?}

Sanskrit has two different sets of verb endings: {s parasmaipada} endings and
{s Atmanepada} endings. Some roots always use {s parasmaipada} endings, some
roots always use {s Atmanepada} endings, and some roots can use both.

For a small number of roots, {s Atmanepada} endings imply that the person
performing the action is doing so for their own benefit. Here is the classic
example:

{ex

devadatta odanaM paca[ti].
Devadatta cooks rice ([for others]).

devadatta odanaM paca[te].
Devadatta cooks rice ([for himself]).

}

In older Sanskrit, this distinction is more meaningful. But in later Sanskrit,
there is little to no difference in meaning between these two sets of endings.


{h The present tense}

Here are the {s Atmanepada} endings of the present tense:

{verb
    nayate nayete nayante
    nayase nayethe nayadhve
    naye nayAvahe nayAmahe
}

First, notice that all of these endings end in {s -e} in the present tense.
Also, notice that many of these endings are similar to their {s parasmaipada}
counterparts. Here are the similar forms:

{verb
    nayati nayataH nayanti
    nayasi nayathaH -
    - nayAvaH nayAmaH
}


{h The command mood}

Here are the endings for the command mood:

{verb
    nayatAm nayetAm nayantAm
    nayasva nayethAm nayadhvam
    nayai nayAvahai nayAmahai
}

As before, focus on these five endings, which the next two tense-moods will
mostly reuse:

{verb
    - tAm -
    - thAm dhvam
    - vahai mahai
}


{h The ordinary past tense}

As before, the forms of the ordinary past tense have an {s a-} prefix:

{verb
    anayata anayetAm anayanta
    anayathAH anayethAm anayadhvam
    anaye anayAvahi anayAmahi
}

The first person uses the endings {s -vahi} and {s -mahi} instead of the {s
-vahai} and {s -mahai} used above.


{h The potential mood}

As before, the potential mood uses nearly the same endings as the ordinary past
tense. And as before, all of these endings start with {s -I}:

{verb
    nayeta nayeyAtAm nayeran
    nayeH nayeyAtham nayedhvam
    nayeya nayevahi nayemahi
}

As before, the one exception is the third-person plural ending:

{ex

anayanta.
They led.

nayeran.
They might lead.

}


{h Review}

    {li In later Sanskrit, is there a strong difference in meaning between {s
parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada} endings?}
