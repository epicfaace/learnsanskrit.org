{title Special tense-moods}

In the core lessons, we learned that we can change a verb {em root} into a
verb {em stem}. And once we have a verb stem, we can add {em endings} to that
stem to create a complete verb.

In the examples below, note the progression from root to stem to verb:

{ex

[nI] > naya > nayanti
lead > lead > They lead.

[nI] > neSya > neSyAmi
lead > will lead > I will lead.

}

We also learned that Sanskrit verbs express five basic kinds of information.
These five are called {dfn person}, which expresses the verb's perspective:

{ex

nayati.
(Someone) leads

nayAmi.
I lead.

}

{dfn number}, which expresses how many of something there are:

{ex

nayati.
(Someone) leads.

nayanti.
They lead.

}

{dfn tense-mood}, which expresses the verb's {dfn tense} (time period) and {dfn
mood} (manner):

{ex

nayati.
(Someone) leads.

neSyati
(Someone) will lead.

nayet
(Someone) might lead.

}

{s-dfn prayoga}, which is hard to explain but easy to understand:

{ex

nayati.
(Someone) leads.
(`kartari `prayoga)

nIyate
(Someone) is led.
(`karmaNi `prayoga)

}

and {s-dfn pada}, which is meaningful only for certain roots. We will discuss
{s pada} more in a later lesson, but here is a simple example of it:

{ex

nayati.
(Someone) leads (for another's benefit).
(`parasmaipada)

nayate.
(Someone) leads (for their own benefit).
(`Atmanepada)

}


{h Four special tense-moods}

Let's focus on tense-moods here. Sanskrit uses ten different tense-moods. But
{em four} of these tense-moods use very similar stems in {s kartari prayoga}.
You can see all four of these tense-moods below:

{ex

nayati
(Someone) leads.

nayatu
(Someone) should lead.

anayat
(Someone) led.

nayet
(Someone) might or could lead.

}

Since these four tense-moods use a special stem, they are sometimes called {dfn
special tense-moods}. They are called "special" only because of the stem they
use. Otherwise, they are like any other verb.


{h Ten stem patterns}

We form the stems for these four special tense-moods in {em ten different
patterns}. Generally, each root uses just one of these ten patterns.

The most common pattern is that we strengthen the root vowel and add {s -a}:

{ex

nI > nayati, nayatu, anayat, nayet
lead > (someone) leads, should lead, led, might lead

}

For other roots, we might add a suffix like {s -aya} instead:

{ex

cur > corayati, corayatu, acorayat, corayet
steal > (someone) steals, should steal, stole, might steal


}

And for a few roots, we might even make a more drastic change:

{ex

hu > juhoti, juhotu, ajuhot, juhuyAt
offer > (someone) offers, should offer, offered, might offer

}

Since roots change in ten different ways, we can sort these roots into ten
different {dfn verb classes}. Each verb class has its own characteristic
change.

In this topic, we will learn about verb classes and the four special
tense-moods that use them.
