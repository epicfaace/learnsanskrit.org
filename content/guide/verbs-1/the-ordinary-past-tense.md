{title The ordinary past tense}
{aka the imperfect, {s anadyatana-bhUta} ("past action not of today"), {s laG}}


{h Basic meaning}

The {dfn ordinary past tense} technically refers to past actions that occurred
before today. But in practice, it refers to any past action:

{ex

rAmo laGkAm [agacchat].
Rama went to Lanka.

rAmaH sItAm [apazyat].
Rama saw Sita.

}

Note the {s a-} at the beginning of each verb:

{ex

gacchati > [a]gacchat
goes > went

}

Many of the tense-moods that describe past events will add this {s a-} sound to
the beginning of the stem.


{h Endings}

Here are the endings of the ordinary past tense as used with the stem {s naya}:

{verb
    anayat anayatAm anayan
    anayaH anayatam anayata
    anayam anayAva anayAma
}

Notice that many of these endings are shortened versions of the present tense
endings. Endings that end with {s -i} lose that {s -i}:

{ex

nayati > anayat

nayasi > anayaH

nayAmi > anayam

nayanti > anayan

}

And endings that end with the {s visarga} lose that {s visarga}:

{ex

nayAvaH > anayAva

nayAmaH > anayAma

}


{h Using verb prefixes}

If the verb uses a verb prefix, we add that prefix {em before} the {s a-}:

{ex

parigacchati > paryagacchat
goes around > went around

}

Why does this happen? In early Sanskrit, verb prefixes were ordinary
uninflected words that could occur anywhere in the sentence. Here is a simple
example:

{ex

pari grAmam agacchat.
He went around the village.

}

In later Sanskrit, however, these words are almost always placed just before
the verb. And over time, they were treated as a single word:

{ex

pari agacchat > paryagacchat.

}
