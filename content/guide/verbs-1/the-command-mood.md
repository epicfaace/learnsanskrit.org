{title The command mood}
{aka the imperative mood, {s AjJA} ("command"), {s loT}}

The present tense and the {dfn command mood} use similar endings. So, let's
learn about the command mood next.


{h Basic meaning}

The command mood is used for commands. We commonly see the command mood in the
second person:

{ex

naya
Lead!

nayata
(You all) lead!

}

But in other persons, the command mood has many more subtle meanings. In the
third person, it can have the sense of a suggestion, a demand, or a request:

{ex

rAmo vanaM [gacchatu].
Rama [could go] to the forest. (suggestion)
[Send] Rama to the forest. (demand or request)

}

The command mood is rarely used in the first person. When it is used, it
usually has the sense of fulfilling another's need:

{ex

kiM [karavANi] te?
What [may I do] for you?

}


{h Endings}

Here are the endings of the command mood as used with the stem {s naya}:

{verb
    nayatu nayatAm nayantu
    naya nayatam nayata
    nayAni nayAva nayAma
}

Let's take a moment to compare these endings to the ones used in the present
tense. Notice that the first-person endings still use a long {s A}. There are
other similarities as well: {s nayati} is replaced by {s nayatu}, and {s
nayanti} by {s nayantu}.

But there are also some major differences. In particular, notice these five
endings:

{verb
    - tAm -
    - tam ta
    - va ma
}

These five endings will repeat in the next two tense-moods.
