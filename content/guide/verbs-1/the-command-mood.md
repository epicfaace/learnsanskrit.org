{title The command mood}
{aka the imperative mood, {s AjJA} ("command"), {s loT}}

The present tense and the {dfn command mood} use similar endings. So, let's
learn about the command mood next.


{h Basic meaning}

The command mood is used for commands. We commonly see the command mood in the
second person:

{ex

naya
Lead!

nayata
(You all) lead!

}

But in the first and third persons, it has slightly different meanings:

{ex

rAmo vanaM [gacchatu]
[May] Rama [go] to the forest.

kim [karavANi] te?
What [may I do] for you?

}


{h Endings}

Here are the endings of the command mood as used with the stem {s naya}:

{verb
    nayatu nayatAm nayantu
    naya nayatam nayata
    nayAni nayAva nayAma
}

Notice that the first-person endings still use a long {s A}. There are other
similarities as well: {s nayati} is replaced by {s nayatu}, and {s nayanti}
by {s nayantu}.

But there are also some major differences. In particular, notice these five
endings:

{verb
    - tAm -
    - tam ta
    - va ma
}

These five endings will repeat in the next two tense-moods.
