{title {s karmaNi} and {s bhAve prayoga}}
{aka patientive and impersonal usage; the "passive voice"}

We have now seen all of the ten classes of the special tense moods. We will end
this topic by briefly discussing {s prayoga}.

As a reminder, Sanskrit verbs use one of three {s prayoga}s. We have {s kartari
prayoga} ("agent usage"):

{ex

rAmo nagaraM [gacchati].
Rama [goes] to the city.

kumbhakarNaH [svapiti].
Kumbhakarna [sleeps].

}

{s karmaNi prayoga} ("object usage"), which can be used if the verb uses an
object:

{ex

rAmeNa nagaraM [gamyate].
The city [is gone to] by Rama.

}

And {s bhAve prayoga} ("stative usage"), which can be used if the verb doesn't
use an object:

{ex

kumbhakarNena [supyate].
Kumbhakarna sleeps. ("[There is sleeping] by Kumbhakarna.")

}

{s prayoga} does not affect the meaning of the verb or the sentence. Instead,
it is a different way of expressing the same information. It is like the
difference between "I go to the store" and "The store was gone to by me." Both
express the same information, but their style and emphasis differ.

So far, all of the lessons in this topic have focused on {s kartari prayoga}.
In this topic, we will learn how to express the four special tense-moods in {s
karmaNi prayoga} and {s bhAve prayoga}:

{ex

rAvaNo hanyate
Ravana is being killed.

rAvaNo hanyatAm
May Ravana be killed.

rAvaNo 'hanyata
Ravana was killed.

rAvaNo hanyeta
Ravana might be killed.

}

{aside

{h Active, middle, passive voice}

English-languages resources often use the terms "active," "middle," and
"passive" voices to describe the various combinations of {s prayoga} and {s
pada}:

{ul
    {li active voice: {s kartari prayoga}, {s parasmaipada}}
    {li middle voice: {s kartari prayoga}, {s Atmanepada}}
    {li passive voice: {s karmaNi} and {s bhAve prayoga} (always {s Atmanepada})}
}

These terms are workable, but they don't fit well with how Sanskrit works. So
in our guide, we prefer to use the terms {s pada} and {s prayoga}. 

}


{h A new stem}

We express {s karmaNi prayoga} and {s bhAve prayoga} in similar ways. First, we
add the suffix {s ya} to the root:

{ex

nI + ya > nIya
lead > be led

}

Then we use {s Atmanepada} endings. In {s karmaNi prayoga}, the person and
number should agree with the {em object} of the sentence:

{ex

ahaM gajAn [nayAmi].
I lead the elephants.
(Verb is first-person singular like `aham)

mayA gajA [nIyante].
By me, the elephants are led.
(Verb is third-person plural like `gajAH)

}

And in {s bhAve prayoga}, we use the third person singular:

{ex

mayA supyate.
I sleep. ("There is sleeping by me")

naraiH supyate.
The men sleep. ("There is sleeping by the men")

}


{h Adding the {s -ya} suffix}

Generally, we can add {s -ya} directly to the root:

{ex

nI > nIyate
lead > is led

}

But roots that end in short vowels use a long vowel:

{ex

ji > jIyate
conquer > is conquered

}

Roots that end in {s -A} and {s -ai} usually use {s -I} instead:

{ex

sthA > sthIyate
stand > is stood or stationed

gai > gIyate
sing > is sung

dA > dIyate
give > is given

}

If the root ends in {s -R}, that {s -R} becomes {s -ri}:

{ex

kR > kriyate
do > is done

}

But it becomes {s -ar} if it follows a consonant cluster:

{ex

smR > smaryate
remember > is remembered

}

Roots that end in {s RR} use {s -Ir}, or {s Ur} if the root starts with a "lip"
consonant:

{ex

tRR > tIryate
cross > is crossed

pRR > pUryate
fill > is filled

}

Finally, a few roots undergo an interesting change. Their semivowels become
vowels, and any other vowels they have are removed:

{ex

vac > ucyate
speak > is spoken, is said

svap > supyate
sleep > there is sleeping

yaj > ijyate
sacrifice > is sacrificed

prach > pRcchyate
ask > is asked

}

This change is called {s-dfn samprasAraNa} in traditional grammar. 

{aside

{h The intuition behind {s samprasAraNa}}

There is a clear intuition behind {s samprasAraNa}. Roughly, roots that use {s
samprasAraNa} have already been strengthened. But they have all been
strengthened in an unusual way: the {s a} vowel has been added {em after} the
root vowel, not before it. 

So when we use {s samprasAraNa} roots, we often must weaken the root back to
the normal level. We do so by removing the {s a} sound and undoing any sandhi
changes.

{h Review}

{s karmaNi prayoga} is common in Sanskrit, so it is worth knowing well. {s
bhAve prayoga} is much less common, but it still appears occasionally.

    {li Do we use {s parasmaipada} endings in {s karmaNi} and {s bhAve
    prayoga}?}
