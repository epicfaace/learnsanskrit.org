{title The {s bhU}, {s div}, {s tud}, and {s cur} classes}

We have learned that there are four special tense-moods and that we create
stems for these special tense-moods in ten different patterns. We can sort all
verb roots into ten different lists based on which pattern they use. These
lists are called {dfn verb classes}.

Four of these verb classes are quite simple to create and use:

{ex

bhU > bhava
become

div > dIvya
gamble

tud > tuda
strike

cur > coraya
steal

}

Let's call these four classes the {dfn simple verb classes}. Each class is
named after the first root in its list.


{h The {s bhU} class}

The {dfn {s bhU} class} is the largest of the ten verb classes and contains
almost half of all verb roots. Here are some examples of this class:

{ex

nI > nayati
lead > (someone) leads

zuc > zocati
grieve > (someone) grieves

nind > nindati
deride > (someone) derides

jIv > jIvati
live > (someone) lives

}

For most roots in this class, we create a stem by {em strengthening} the root
vowel and adding the suffix {s -a}. Here are some examples:

{ex

bhU > bho + a > bhava
become

nI > ne + a > naya
lead

zuc > zoc + a > zoca
grieve

}

However, there are some roots that don't use a strengthened vowel. For example,
roots whose vowel is {s a} don't change:

{ex

has > hasa
laugh

}

But if a root's syllable would be heavy even after we add {s -a}, then we don't
strengthen the root:

{ex

nind > ninda
blame

jIv > jIva
live

}

There are also several roots that form their stems in an unpredictable way.
Such stems are called {dfn irregular} stems. Here are some common examples of
irregular stems:

{table
{tr {th Root} {th Verb} {th Meaning}}
{tr {td {s-dr sthA}} {td {s-dr tiSThati}} {td stand}}
{tr {td {s-dr pA}} {td {s-dr pibati}} {td drink}}
{tr {td {s-dr dRz}} {td {s-dr pazyati}} {td see}}
{tr {td {s-dr gam}} {td {s-dr gacchati}} {td go}}
}

The roots that use irregular stems are all common, and you will see and hear
them many times as you engage with real Sanskrit content. So although you might
be tempted to memorize these forms, you will likely acquire them naturally as
you continue to read and listen to Sanskrit.

{aside

{h Why is the root {s dRz}?}

The ancient grammarians decided on verb roots by analyzing all of a verb's
tense-moods and derived forms. Words like {s pazyati}, {s pazyet}, {s pasyatu},
and {s apazyat} strongly suggest a root like {s paz}. But we must also consider 
words like {s drakSyati} ("will see"), {s dadarza} ("saw long ago"), {s
adrAkSIt} ("saw"), {s dRzyate} ("is seen"), and so on.

Given a choice between {s dRz} and {s paz}, the grammarians chose {s dRz} to
represent these verbs. The specific reasons are complicated to explain right
now. But the simple reason is {s dRz} makes it easier to talk about certain
general patterns in Sanskrit.

This same logic explains some of the other irregular roots above.

{h The {s div} class}

For roots in the {dfn {s div} class}, we form a stem by adding {s -ya} to the
root. No vowel strengthening occurs:

{ex

muh > muhya
become confused

}

This class has a few irregular stems. Usually, these irregular stems lengthen
the root's vowel. Here are a few examples:

{table
    {tr {th Root} {th Verb} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr div}} {td {s-dr dIvyati}} {td gamble}}
    {tr {td {s-dr jan}} {td {s-dr jAyate}} {td be born}}
    {tr {td {s-dr zam}} {td {s-dr zAmyati}} {td be tired or calm}}
    {tr {td {s-dr mad}} {td {s-dr mAdyati}} {td be intoxicated}}
}



{h The {s tud} class}

For roots in the {dfn {s tud} class}, we form a stem by adding {s -a} to the
root. No vowel strengthening occurs:

{ex

tud > tuda
strike

}

The irregular stems in this class usually have an extra nasal sound:

{table
    {tr {th Root} {th Stem} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr muc}} {td {s-dr muJca}} {td release}}
    {tr {td {s-dr kRt}} {td {s-dr kRntati}} {td cut}}
    {tr {td {s-dr lip}} {td {s-dr limpati}} {td anoint or smear}}
    {tr {td {s-dr sic}} {td {s-dr ziJcati}} {td sprinkle}}
}

{aside

{h Why isn't {s nind} in the {s tud} class?}

If {s nind} doesn't strengthen its vowel, why isn't it in the {s tud} class? 
This is a great question. The answer ultimately has to do with different {em
vowel accents} in Sanskrit.

Old Sanskrit has a feature called {em pitch accent}, where some vowels are
spoken with a higher pitch than others. This pitch accent can still be heard in
Vedic recitation. And even the spoken Sanskrit around that time used pitch
accent extensively.

The roots in the {s tud} class generally have a high accent on their {s -a}
suffix, and the roots in the {s bhU} class generally do not. This is part of
the reason {s nind} is in the {s bhU} class.

}


{h The {s cur} class}

For most roots in the {dfn {s cur} class}, we create the stem by {em
strengthening} the root vowel and adding the suffix {s -aya}. Here are some
examples:

{ex

cur > coraya
steal

}

The irregular stems in this class usually have extra sounds between the roots
and the {s -aya} suffix:

{table
    {tr {th Root} {th Stem} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr prI}} {td {s-dr prINayati}} {td please}}
    {tr {td {s-dr dhU}} {td {s-dr dhUnayati}} {td shake}}
}
