{title {s karmaNi} and {s bhAve prayoga}}
{aka the passive voice and impersonal usage}

As a reminder, Sanskrit verbs use one of three {s prayoga}s. We have {s kartari
prayoga} ("agent usage"):

{ex

rAmo nagaraM [gacchati].
Rama [goes] to the city.

kumbhakarNaH svapiti.
Kumbhakarna sleeps.

}

{s karmaNi prayoga} ("object usage"), which can be used if the verb uses an
object:

{ex

rAmeNa nagaraM [gamyate].
The city [is gone to] by Rama.

}

And {s bhAve prayoga} ("stative usage"), which can be used if the verb doesn't
use an object:

{ex

kumbhakarNena supyate.
Kumbhakarna sleeps. ("There is sleeping by Kumbhakarna.")

}

{s prayoga} does not affect the meaning of the verb or the sentence. Instead,
it is a different way of expressing the same information. It is like the
difference between "I go to the store" and "The store was gone to by me." Both
express the same information, but their style and emphasis differ.

So far, all of the lessons in this topic have focused on {s kartari prayoga}.
In this topic, we will learn how to express the four special tense-moods in {s
karmaNi prayoga} and {s bhAve prayoga}:

{ex

rAvaNo hanyate
Ravana is being killed.

rAvaNo hanyatAm
May Ravana be killed.

rAvaNo 'hanyata
Ravana was killed.

rAvaNo hanyeta
Ravana might be killed.

}


{h A new stem}

We express {s karmaNi prayoga} and {s bhAve prayoga} in similar ways. First, we
add the suffix {s ya} to the root:

{ex

nI + ya > nIya
lead > be led

}

Then we use {s Atmanepada} endings. In {s karmaNi prayoga}, the person and
number should agree with the {em object} of the sentence:

{ex

ahaM gajAn [nayAmi].
I lead the elephants.
(Verb is first-person singular like `aham)

mayA gajA [nIyante].
By me, the elephants are led.
(Verb is third-person plural like `gajAH)

}

And in {s bhAve prayoga}, we use the third person singular:

{ex

mayA supyate.
I sleep. ("There is sleeping by me")

naraiH supyate.
The men sleep. ("There is sleeping by the men")

}


{h Adding the {s -ya} suffix}

Generally, we can add {s -ya} directly to the root:

{ex

nI > nIyate
lead > is led

}

But roots that end in short vowels use a long vowel:

{ex

ji > jIyate
conquer > is conquered

}

And there are a few irregular roots worth knowing, as well:

{ex

sthA > sthIyate
stand > is stood or stationed

dA > dIyate
give > is given

}

If the root ends in {s -R}, that {s -R} becomes {s -ri}, or {s -ar} if it
follows a consonant cluster:

{ex

kR > kriyate
do > is done

smR > smaryate
remember > is remembered

}

Roots that end in {s RR} use {s -Ir}, or {s Ur} if the root starts with a "lip"
consonant:

{ex

tRR > tIryate
cross > is crossed

pRR > pUryate
fill > is filled

}

Finally, some roots undergo an interesting change. Their semivowels become
vowels, and any other vowels they have are removed:

{ex

vac > ucyate
speak > is spoken, is said

svap > supyate
sleep > there is sleeping

yaj > ijyate
sacrifice > is sacrificed

prach > pRcchyate
ask > is asked

}

This change is called {s-dfn samprasAraNa} in traditional grammar.


{h Review}

{s karmaNi prayoga} is common in Sanskrit, so it is worth knowing well.

{ol
    {li Do we use {s parasmaipada} endings in {s karmaNi} and {s bhAve
    prayoga}?}
