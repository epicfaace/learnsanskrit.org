{title The present tense}
{aka the present indicative, {s vartamAnaH} ("occurring"), {s laT}}

The first tense-mood we will study is the {dfn present tense}. Traditionally,
this is the first tense-mood that Sanskrit students learn.


{h Basic meaning}

The present tense has different meanings in different contexts. Most commonly,
it what is happening right now:

{ex

nayati.
(Someone) leads or is leading.

carati.
(Someone) walks or is walking.

}

Notice that the English translation of {s nayati} is either "leads" or "is
leading." In Sanskrit, we describe both of these with the same verb form.
Context makes the specific sense clear.

In general, the present tense is seen as a "default" tense. So we can also use
it to describe actions that regularly occur:

{ex

ahaM pratidinaM [pacAmi].
I [cook] every day.

saMjayaH prativarSaM nagaraM [gacchati].
Sanjaya [goes] to the city every year.

}

The present tense also expresses actions that have just finished:

{ex

tvam kadA grAmam [Agacchasi].
When [did you come] to the village?
(It is implied that the person has come very recently.)

}

or are just about to occur:

{ex

ahaM vanam [gacchAmi].
I [(am just about to) go] to the forest.

}

In the first person, it can also have the sense of "let's":

{ex

gacchAmaH.
Let's (all) go.

rAjAnaM pRcchAvaH.
Let's (both) ask the king.

}

We can modify the basic sense of the present tense with various uninflected
words. One common example is that we can use {s sma} to express past action:

{ex

siMho guhAyAM [nivasati sma].
The lion [lived (or, was living)] in the cave.

}


{h Endings}

Here are the endings we use in the present tense. The examples below use the
stem {s naya}:

{verb
    nayati nayataH nayanti
    nayasi nayathaH nayatha
    nayAmi nayAvaH nayAmaH
}

The table above has three rows and three columns. Each row corresponds to a
different person, and you can see these persons labeled on the left-hand side.
Each column corresponds to a different number, and you can see these numbers
labeled on the top. For example, we can use this table to learn that the "3rd
person singular" form is {s nayati}.

Why do we put these words in a table? It's not so that we can sit down and
memorize these forms. In our view, that's a waste of time. Mainly, a table lets
us see certain patterns clearly.

Here are some patterns that stand out to us:

{ul
    {li All of the first-person forms have a long {s A} sound in their ending.}
    {li All of the singular forms end in {s -i}.}
    {li The sound {s tha} is used only in the second person.}
}


{h Review}

The present tense is simple and straightforward. In the next lesson, we will
learn about the command mood, which uses similar endings to the present tense.
