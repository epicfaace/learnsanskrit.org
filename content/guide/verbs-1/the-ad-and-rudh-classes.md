{title The {s ad} and {s rudh} classes}

In the previous lesson, we learned about three of the six complex verb classes:

{table
    {tr {th Root} {th Strong stem} {th Weak stem}}
    {tr {td {s-dr su}} {td {s-dr suno}} {td {s-dr sunu}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tan}} {td {s-dr tano}} {td {s-dr tanu}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr krI}} {td {s-dr krINA}} {td {s-dr krINI}}}
}

In this lesson, we will learn about two more complex verb classes. Both of
these classes can create stems that end with consonant sounds. And since many
verb endings {em start} with consonants, these classes might cause various
sandhi changes:

{ex

dveS + ti > dveSTi
(someone) hates

}


{h The {s ad} class}
{aka class 2, {s adAdigaNa} ("the group starting with {s ad}")}

The {dfn {s ad} class} does not use a suffix. Instead, its strong stem is the
root with a strengthened vowel, and its weak stem is the root itself.

The root {s ad} has {s ad} for its strong stem and the same {s ad} for its weak
stem. So, {s ad} does not demonstrate these changes well. Instead, let's use
the root {s dviS} ("hate"), which has a clearer difference between its strong
and weak stems:

{ex

dveSTi.
(Someone) hates.

dviSanti.
They hate.

}

For the word {s dveSTi}, notice that the root ends with a consonant ({s S}) and
the ending begins with a consonant ({s t}). By a sandhi change, a {s t} after
{s S} becomes {s T}, so we get the result {s dveSTi}.

The {s ad} class has many irregular roots. The most important irregular root of
the {s ad} class is {s as}, which means "be" or "exist." Its strong stem is {s
as}, and its weak stem is {s s}:

{ex

vanam asti.
There is a forest.

vAnarA vane santi.
Monkeys are in the forest.

}


{h The {s rudh} class}
{aka class 7, {s rudhAdigaNa} ("the group starting with {s rudh}")}

Like the {s ad} class, the {dfn {s rudh} class} also doesn't use a suffix.
Instead, we create the strong and weak stems by inserting a nasal sound after
the root's last vowel. For the strong stem, we insert {s na}. For the weak
stem, we insert {s n}:

{ex

rudh > ruNaddhi
(Someone) obstructs.

rudh > rundhanti
They obstruct.

}

Again, notice the sandhi change:

{ex

ruNadh + ti > ruNaddhi

}

And as a reminder, {s r} generally causes nearby {s n} sounds to become {s N}.
Hence we have {s ruNaddhi} and not {err}{s runaddhi}. (We use the {err} symbol
to show that this word is not correct Sanskrit.)


{h Endings of the {s ad} class}

With one or two exceptions, the {s ad} class uses the same endings as the {s
krI} class. But since the {s ad} class may cause many sandhi changes, these
endings may not always be clear. We want to show you what these changes are
like, so we will show you all of the forms of {s dviS} in the special
tense-moods.

First, here are the {s parasmaipada} forms of {s dviS} in the present tense:

{verb
    dveSTi-s dviSTaH dviSanti
    dvekSi-s dviSThaH dviSTha
    dveSmi-s dviSvaH dviSmaH
}

Next, here is the command mood:

{verb
    dveSTu-s dviSTAm dviSantu
    dviDDhi dviSTam dviSTa
    dveSANi-s dveSAva-s dveSAma-s
}

In the second-person singular, we use {s dhi} instead of {s hi} if the root
ends in a consonant. Then {s dviS + dhi} becomes {s dviDDhi} due to sandhi.

Next, we have the ordinary past tense:

{verb
    adveT-s adviSTAm adviSan
    adveT-s adviSTam adviSTa
    adveSam-s adviSva adviSma
}

{note
Why do we use {s adveT}? This is due to a complex rule of consonant sandhi.
Read our lessons on consonant sandhi to learn more.
}

If the root ends in {s -A}, we can also use the ending {s -uH} instead of {s
-an}:

{ex

yA > ayAn, ayuH
They went.

}

Finally, we have the the potential mood:

{verb
    dviSyAt dviSyAtAm dviSyuH
    dviSyAH dviSyAtam dviSyAta
    dviSyAm dviSyAva dviSyAma
}

Now, here are the {s Atmanepada} forms of {s dviS} in the present tense:

{verb
    dviSTe dviSAte dviSate
    dvikSe dviSAthe dviDDhve
    dviSe dviSvahe dviSmahe
}

the command mood:

{verb
    dviSTAm dviSAtAm dviSatAm
    dvikSva dviSAthAm dviDDhvam
    dveSai-s dveSAvahai-s dveSAmahai-s
}

the ordinary past tense:

{verb
    adviSTa adviSAtAm adviSata
    adviSThAH adviSAthAm adviDDhvam
    adviSi adviSvahi adviSmahi
}

and the potential mood:

{verb
    dviSIta dviSIyAtAm dviSIran
    dviSIthAH dviSIyAthAm dviSIDhvam
    dviSIya dviSIvahi dviSImahi
}


{h Endings of the {s rudh} class}

The {s rudh} class uses the same endings as the {s krI} class. But as before,
the {s rudh} class may cause many different sandhi changes.

Here are the {s parasmaipada} forms of {s rudh} in the present tense:

{verb
    ruNaddhi-s runddhaH rundhanti
    ruNatsi-s runddhaH runddha
    ruNadhmi-s rundhvaH rundhmaH
}

and the command mood:

{verb
    ruNaddhu-s runddhAm rundhantu
    runddhi runddham runddha
    ruNadhAni-s ruNadhAva-s ruNadhAma-s
}

Next are the forms of the ordinary past tense:

{verb
    aruNat-s arunddhAm arundhan
    aruNat-s arunddham arunddha
    aruNadham-s arundhva arundhma
}

{note
Why do we use {s aruNat}? Again, this is due to a complex rule of consonant
sandhi. Read our lessons on consonant sandhi to learn more.
}

Finally, we have the potential mood:

{verb
    rundhyAt rundhyAtAm rundhyuH
    rundhyAH rundhyAtam rundhyAta
    rundhyAm rundhyAva rundhyAma
}

Next, we have the {s Atmanepada} forms of {s rudh} in the present tense:

{verb
    runddhe rundhAte rundhate
    runtse rundhAthe runddhve
    rundhe rundhvahe rundhmahe
}

the command mood:

{verb
    runddhAm rundhAtAm rundhatAm
    runtsva rundhAthAm runddhvam
    ruNadhai-s ruNadhAvahai-s ruNadhAmahai-s
}

the ordinary past tense:

{verb
    arunddha arundhAtAm arundhata
    arunddhAH arundhAthAm arunddhvam
    arundhi arundhvahi arundhmahi
}

and the potential mood:

{verb
    rundhIta rundhIyAtAm rundhIran
    rundhIthAH rundhIyAthAm rundhIdhvam
    rundhIya rundhIvahi rundhImahi
}


{h Review}

The {s ad} and {s rudh} classes cause many different sandhi changes. But we can
learn these forms through exposure over time, and we can understand their
meanings from context.

{ol
    {li What are the strong and weak stems of {s dviS}?}
    {li What are the strong and weak stems of {s rudh}?}
