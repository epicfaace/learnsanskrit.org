{title The {s hu} class}
{aka class 3, {s juhotyAdigaNa} ("the group starting with {s juhoti}")}

The last class we will consider is the {dfn {s hu} class}. The {s hu} class
forms its stems in a unique way. It does not use a special suffix, and we do
not insert any new sounds. Instead, we {dfn double} the root in a special way:

{ex

hu > juhu
offer

}

Then the strong stem uses a strengthened vowel and the weak stem has no extra
change:

{ex

juhoti.
(Someone) offers.

juhutaH.
(The two of them) offer.

}

{note
The {s hu} class is rare, but doubling is not. Many different kinds of Sanskrit
verbs use doubling, and we will see more examples of it in other lessons.
}

{h Basic rules of doubling}

Long vowels become short:

{ex

dA dA > dadA

}

Aspirated sounds become unaspirated:

{ex

dhA dhA > dadhA

}

Sounds pronounced at the soft palate ({s ka}) shift to the hard palate ({s
ca}):

{ex

ki ki > ciki

hu hu > juhu

}

There are other minor rules, but these are the common patterns.


{h Irregular roots}

The {s hu} class has many irregular roots. The most important are {s dA}
("give") and {s dhA} ("place"). {s dA} uses the strong stem {s dadA} and uses
weak stem {s dad}:

{ex

rAmaH phalaM sItAyai dadAti.
Rama gives the fruit to Sita.

te phalAni rAmAya dadati.
They give the fruits to Rama.

}

It also has the irregular command form {s dehi}:

{ex 

dehi me phalam!
Give me a fruit!

}

{s dhA} generally follows the same pattern as {s dA}.


{h Endings of the {s hu} class}

The {s hu} class generally uses the same {s parasmaipada} endings as the other
complex classes. In the present tense, we use {s -ati} instead of {s -anti}:

{verb
    juhoti-s juhutaH juhvati
    juhoSi-s juhuthaH juhutha
    juhomi-s juhuvaH juhumaH
}

The command mood is normal, but we use the ending {s -dhi} instead of {s -hi}:

{verb
    juhotu-s juhutAm juhvatu
    juhudhi juhutam juhuta
    juhavAni-s juhavAva-s juhavAma-s
}

The ordinary past tense is normal, but we use the ending {s -uH} instead of {s
-an}. This ending causes a vowel change, so we get {s ajuhavuH} instead of *{s
ajuhuvuH}:

{verb
    ajuhot-s ajuhutAm ajuhavuH
    ajuhoH-s ajuhutam ajuhuta
    ajuhavam-s ajuhuva ajuhuma
}

And the potential mood is normal:

{verb
    juhuyAt juhuyAtAm juhuyuH
    juhuyAH juhuyAtam juhuyAta
    juhuyAm juhuyAva juhuyAma
}

The {s Atmanepada} endings are the same as for the other complex classes.


{h Review}

We have now seen all ten of the Sanskrit verb classes. Below, you can see all
ten of these classes in their traditional order. We illustrate the {s ad} class
with the root {s dviS}, and we leave the weak stem blank for roots in the
simple verb classes:

{table
    {tr {th Class} {th Strong stem} {th Weak stem}}
    {tr {td {s-dr bhU}} {td {s-dr bhava}} {td {s-dr --}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr ad}} {td {s-dr dveS}} {td {s-dr dviS}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr hu}} {td {s-dr juho}} {td {s-dr juhu}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr div}} {td {s-dr dIvya}} {td {s-dr --}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr su}} {td {s-dr suno}} {td {s-dr sunu}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tud}} {td {s-dr tuda}} {td {s-dr --}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr rudh}} {td {s-dr runadh}} {td {s-dr rundh}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tan}} {td {s-dr tano}} {td {s-dr tanu}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr krI}} {td {s-dr krINA}} {td {s-dr krINI}}}
    {tr {td {s-dr cur}} {td {s-dr coraya}} {td {s-dr --}}}
}

As you read and listen to more Sanskrit, you will be able to use these classes
instinctively.

    {li How do we double the root {s bhI}?}
