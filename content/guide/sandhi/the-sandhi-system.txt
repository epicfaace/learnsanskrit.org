{title The sandhi system}

When we speak quickly, we make many kinds of small and subconscious changes to
the way we speak. In Sanskrit, these sound changes are called {dfn sandhi},
which means "joining" or "junction." In this topic, we will study the different
types of sandhi in more detail.

There are many different kinds of sandhi changes. If a vowel comes first, it is
called {dfn vowel sandhi}:

{ex

sItA udakam icchati > [sItodakam] icchati
Sita wants water.

}

If a {s visarga} comes first, it is called {dfn {s visarga} sandhi}:

{ex

rAmaH udakam icchati > [rAma] udakam icchati
Rama wants water.

}

And if a consonant comes first, it is called {dfn consonant sandhi}:

{ex

hanumAn jalam icchati > [hanumAJ] jalam icchati
Hanuman wants water.

}

When we learn about sandhi changes, we should also know {em where} they occur.
Some sandhi changes occur between the different parts of a {em single word}:

{ex

ne + a + nti > nayanti
They lead.

gaja + ina > gajena
by the elephant

}

Others occur between {em two different words}:

{ex

sItA udakam icchati. > sItodakam icchati.
Sita wants water.

}

Sandhi changes {em within} a single word must always be followed, and sandhi
changes {em between} words occur optionally. But although these changes are
optional, most Sanskrit texts will use them.
