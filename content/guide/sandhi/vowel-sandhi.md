{title Vowel sandhi}
{aka {s svara-sandhi}, {s ac-sandhi}}

{dfn Vowel sandhi} is the name for sandhi changes between two adjacent vowels.

Here is a simple example of vowel sandhi:

{ex

sItA udakam icchati > [sItodakam] icchati
Sita drinks water.

}


{h Similar vowels}

If the two vowels are similar, they combine and become long:

{ex

sItA azvam icchati > sItAzvam icchati
Sita wants a horse.

zabarI iSum icchati > zabarISum icchati
Shabari wants an arrow.

}

{h Dissimilar vowels}

If the two vowels are not similar, one of three things happens.

First: if the first vowel is simple and not {s a} or {s A}, it becomes a semivowel:

{ex

zabarI azvam icchati > zabary azvam icchati
Shabari wants a horse.

zabarI udakam icchati > zabary udakam icchati
Shabari wants water.

}

Second: if the first vowel is {s a} or {s A}, the two vowels combine and become
a compound vowel:

{ex

sItA udakam icchati > sItodakam icchati
Sita wants water.

}

But if the second vowel is {s R}, {s RR}, or {s L}, it becomes a semivowel
instead:

{ex

sItA RSim pazyati > sItarSiM pazyati
Sita sees a rishi.
(Note that the result is `ar, not `Ar.)

}

Third: if the first vowel is a compound vowel ({s e, ai, o, au}), it becomes {s
ay}, {s Ay}, {s av}, or {s Av}, respectively:

{ex

ne + a + nti > nayanti
They lead.

bho + a + nti > bhavanti
They become.

}

These rules explain most of vowel sandhi. With a few more specific rules, we
will have a nearly complete picture of vowel sandhi in Sanskrit.


{h {s e} at the end of a word}

At the end of a word, {s -e} makes some extra changes. If the second vowel is
{s a}, then {s -e} doesn't change. Instead, the {s a} disappears:

{ex

te azvam icchanti. > te 'zvam icchanti.
They want a horse.

}

This change is similar to what happens in the combination {s aH + a}. {s a}
disappears often in Sanskrit:

{ex

rAmaH azvam icchati. > rAmo 'zvam icchati.
Rama wants a horse.

}

In front of other vowels, {s -e} becomes {s -a}. The idea is that {s -e} first
becomes {s -ay}, as we saw above. Then the {s y} sound is dropped:

{ex

te Amram icchanti. > ta Amram icchanti.
They want a mango.

te udakam icchanti. > ta udakam icchanti.
They want water.

}

In the example of {s ta Amram icchanti}, notice that {s ta} ends with a vowel
and {s Amram} begins with a vowel. Does vowel sandhi happen again? {strong No}.
{s ta} and {s Amram} do not combine further. And likewise, {s ta} and {s
udakam} do not combine further.


{h Vowels that don't use sandhi}

The vowels {s -I}, {s -U} and {s -e}, if they are part of a word that uses the
dual number, are never changed by sandhi:

{ex

agnI apazyam
I saw the two fires.

rAmo bAhU udyacchati
Rama raises his two arms.

tau labhete azvAn
The two of them obtain horses.

}


{h Verb prefixes}

If a verb prefix ends with {s a} or {s A} and the root starts with {s R}, the
two combine to form {s Ar}:

{ex

upa + Rcchati > upArcchati
(Someone) approaches.

}


{h Review}

There are many small details to vowel sandhi. But this lesson is a complete
summary of its most common patterns. As you read more Sanskrit, you will
understand vowel sandhi instinctively.

We do not recommend memorizing the rules above. But it is important to
recognize them so that you can determine where one word ends and another
begins. If you would like to practice, you can try applying the correct sandhi
changes to the examples below:

{ex

sItA eva pRcchati.
Sita herself asks.

azvAH phalAni icchanti.
The horses wants the fruits.

narau nagarANi AgacchataH.
Two men come to the city.

}
