{title Vowel sandhi}
{aka {s svara-sandhi}, {s ac-sandhi}}

{dfn Vowel sandhi} is the name for sandhi changes between two adjacent vowels.

Here is a simple example of vowel sandhi:

{ex

sItA udakam icchati > [sItodakam] icchati
Sita drinks water.

}


{h Table of changes}

Generally, there are two ways we can describe sandhi rules:

{ol
    {li The traditional approach is to study rules. This approach can be
    difficult at first. But over time, it helps us master all of sandhi's
    details.}
    {li The Western approach is to arrange these changes in a table or grid.
    This approach is simplistic and misses many details. But it is often easier
    for beginners to understand.}
}

Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. In this lesson, we will use
both. To start, here is a table that shows the basics of vowel sandhi {em
between two words}:

{sandhi-table
{tr
    {th {s a/A}} {th {s i/I}} {th {s u/U}} {th {s R/RR}}
    {th {s e}} {th {s ai}} {th {s o}} {th {s au}}
}
{tr {s-tds A  | ya  | va  | ra  | e '  | A a  | o '  | Ava} {th {s a}}}
{tr {s-tds A  | yA  | vA  | rA  | a A  | A A  | a A  | AvA} {th {s A}}}
{tr {s-tds e  | I   | vi  | ri  | a i  | A i  | a i  | Avi} {th {s i}}}
{tr {s-tds e  | I   | vI  | rI  | a I  | A I  | a I  | AvI} {th {s I}}}
{tr {s-tds o  | yu  | U   | ru  | a u  | A u  | a u  | Avu} {th {s u}}}
{tr {s-tds o  | yU  | U   | rU  | a U  | A U  | a U  | AvU} {th {s U}}}
{tr {s-tds ar | yR  | vR  | RR  | a R  | A R  | a R  | AvR} {th {s R}}}
{tr {s-tds ar | yRR | vRR | RR  | a RR | A RR | a RR | AvRR} {th {s RR}}}
{tr {s-tds ai | ye  | ve  | re  | a e  | A e  | ave  | Ave} {th {s e}}}
{tr {s-tds ai | yai | vai | rai | a ai | A ai | a ai | Avai} {th {s ai}}}
{tr {s-tds au | yo  | vo  | ro  | a o  | A o  | a o  | Avo} {th {s o}}}
{tr {s-tds au | yau | vau | rau | a au | A au | a au | Avau} {th {s au}}}
}

To use this table, find the first sound on the top row and the second sound on
the right column. The corresponding cell in the table is the result. For
example, if the first sound is {s i} or {s I} and the second sound is {s U},
then the result is {s yU}.


For details, read the rules below.


{h Similar vowels}

If the two vowels are similar, they combine and become long:

{ex

sItA azvam icchati > sItAzvam icchati
Sita wants a horse.

zabarI iSum icchati > zabarISum icchati
Shabari wants an arrow.

}

{h Dissimilar vowels}

If the two vowels are not similar, one of three things happens.

First: if the first vowel is simple and not {s a} or {s A}, it becomes a semivowel:

{ex

zabarI azvam icchati > zabary azvam icchati
Shabari wants a horse.

zabarI udakam icchati > zabary udakam icchati
Shabari wants water.

}

Second: if the first vowel is {s a} or {s A}, the two vowels combine and become
a compound vowel:

{ex

sItA udakam icchati > sItodakam icchati
Sita wants water.

}

But if the second vowel is {s R}, {s RR}, or {s L}, it becomes a semivowel
instead:

{ex

sItA RSim pazyati > sItarSiM pazyati
Sita sees a rishi.
(Note that the result is `ar, not `Ar.)

}

Third: if the first vowel is a compound vowel ({s e, ai, o, au}), it becomes {s
ay}, {s Ay}, {s av}, or {s Av}, respectively:

{ex

ne + a + nti > nayanti
They lead.

bho + a + nti > bhavanti
They become.

}

These rules explain most of vowel sandhi. With a few more specific rules, we
will have a nearly complete picture of vowel sandhi in Sanskrit.


{h Compound vowels at the end of a word}

At the end of a word, the compound vowels {s -e}, {s -ai}, and {s -o} usually
make extra changes.

Let's start with {s -ai} since it changes in a more simple way. {s -ai} becomes
{s -A} when a vowel follows it. The idea is that {s -ai} first becomes {s -Ay},
as we saw above. Then the {s y} sound is dropped:

{ex

tasyai azvam dadAmi > tasyA azvaM dadAmi.
I give her a horse.

tasyai udakam dadAmi > tasyA udakaM dadAmi.
I give her water.

}

In these examples, note that {s tasyA} ends with a vowel and the next word
starts with a vowel. Does vowel sandhi happen again? {strong No}. {s tasyA}
does not combine further.

{s -e} generally follows the same pattern as {s -ai}. {s -e} becomes {s -a} in
front of most vowels:

{ex

te Amram icchanti. > ta Amram icchanti.
They want a mango.

te udakam icchanti. > ta udakam icchanti.
They want water.

}

But if the second vowel is {s a}, then {s -e} doesn't change. Instead, the {s
a} disappears:

{ex

te azvam icchanti. > te [']zvam icchanti.
They want a horse.

}

This change is similar to what happens in the combination {s aH + a}. {s a}
disappears often in Sanskrit:

{ex

rAmaH azvam icchati. > rAmo 'zvam icchati.
Rama wants a horse.

}

{s -o} generally follows the same pattern as {s -e}.


{h Vowels that don't use sandhi}

The vowels {s -I}, {s -U} and {s -e}, if they are part of a word that uses the
dual number, are never changed by sandhi:

{ex

agnI apazyam
I saw the two fires.

rAmo bAhU udyacchati
Rama raises his two arms.

tau labhete azvAn
The two of them obtain horses.

}


{h Verb prefixes}

If a verb prefix ends with {s a} or {s A} and the root starts with {s R}, the
two combine to form {s Ar} instead of the usual {s ar}:

{ex

upa + Rcchati > upArcchati
(Someone) approaches.
(`a + `R becomes `Ar because `upa is a verb prefix.)

sItA Rcchati > sItarcchati
Sita goes.
(`A + `R becomes `ar because `sItA is not a verb prefix.)


}


{h Review}

There are many small details to vowel sandhi. But this lesson is a complete
summary of its most common patterns. As you read more Sanskrit, you will
understand vowel sandhi instinctively.

We do not recommend memorizing the rules above. But if you would like to
practice these rules, you can try applying sandhi changes to the examples
below:

{ex

sItA eva pRcchati.
Sita herself asks.

azvAH phalAni icchanti.
The horses wants the fruits.

narau nagarANi AgacchataH.
Two men come to the city.

}
