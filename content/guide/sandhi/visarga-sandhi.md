{title {s visarga} sandhi}

{dfn {s visarga} sandhi} is the name for sandhi changes where the first sound
is the {s visarga}. Here is a simple example of {s visarga} sandhi:

{ex

rAmaH yoddhum icchati > [rAmo] yoddhum icchati.
Rama wants to fight.

}

Many Sanskrit words end in the {s visarga}, so {s visarga} sandhi is very
common.


{h Where does the {s visarga} come from?}

The {s visarga} itself comes from a sandhi change. {s s} and {s r} become the
{s visarga} when they appear at the end of a word:

{ex

rAmas > rAmaH
Rama

mAtar > mAtaH
mother!

}

Most of the {s visarga}s you hear and see will come from {s s}. A very small
number will come from {s r}. If the {s visarga} comes from {s r}, its sandhi
rules have some small differences. So it is important for us to know which
sound the {s visarga} comes from.


{h Table of changes}

Some learners find it helpful to see these sandhi changes in a table. So, here
is a basic summary of {s visarga} sandhi:

{sandhi-table
{tr {th {s -as}} {th {s -As}} {th {s -s}} {th {s -r}}}
{tr {s-tds o ' | A  | r | r} {th {s a}}}
{tr {s-tds a   | A  | r | r} {th other vowels}}
{tr {s-tds o   | A  | r | r} {th voiced consonants}}
{tr {s-tds az  | Az | z | z} {th {s c, ch}}}
{tr {s-tds aS  | AS | S | S} {th {s T, Th}}}
{tr {s-tds as  | As | s | s} {th {s t, th}}}
{tr {s-tds aH  | AH | H | H} {th other consonants}}
}

To use this table, find the ending of the word on the top row. Then find the
second sound on the right column. The corresponding cell in the table is the
result. For example, if the first term ends in {s -As} and the next one starts
with {s c} or {s ch}, then the result is {s -Az}.


{h Common changes}

Some changes are common and apply to all {s visarga} sounds.

If the second sound is unvoiced, the {s visarga} can become {s z}, {s S}, or
{s s} to match the second sound's point of pronunciation. Here are some
examples:

{ex

bAlaH carati > [bAlaz] carati
The boy walks.

bAlaH TippaNIm paThati > [bAlaS] TippaNIM paThati
The boy reads the commentary.

bAlaH tiSThati > [bAlas] tiSThati
The boy stands.

}

These changes may even occur in front of {s za}, {s Sa}, and {s sa}. But these
changes are usually not written down:

{ex

naraH zilAM gacchati (narazzilAM gacchati)
The man goes to the rock.

naraH SaNDaM gacchati (naraSSaNDaM gacchati)
The man goes to the thicket.

naraH sAgaraM gacchati (narassAgaraM gacchati)
The man goes to the ocean.

}

{h {s -As} sandhi}

If the {s visarga} ends a term that originally ended in {s -As}, then it
disappears if any voiced sound follows:

{ex

narAH udakam pibanti > [narA] udakaM pibanti
The men drink water.

narAH madyam pibanti > [narA] madyaM pibanti
The men drink wine.

narAH vamanti > [narA] vamanti.
The men vomit.

}


{h {s -as} sandhi}

If the {s visarga} ends a term that originally ended in {s -as}, then it
becomes {s o} if any voiced {em consonant} follows:

{ex

naraH madyaM pibati > [naro] madyaM pibati
The man drinks wine.

}

And if the second sound is {s a}, then we replace all three sounds with {s o}:

{ex

naraH amRtaM pibati > [naro ']mRtaM pibati
The man drinks nectar.

}

The {s '} symbol, which is called the {s-dfn avagraha}, often shows that a
vowel was removed due to sandhi.

Otherwise, the {s visarga} disappears before other vowels, just as we saw with
{s -As} above:

{ex

naraH udakam pibati > [nara] udakaM pibati
The man drinks water.

naraH odanam icchati > [nara] odanam icchati
The man wants rice.

}


{h Other changes}

Otherwise, the {s visarga} becomes {s r} in front of any voiced sound:

{ex

agniH asti > [agnir] asti
There is a fire.

vAyuH asti > [vAyur] asti
There is wind.

dvAH (dvAr) asti > [dvAr] asti
There is a door.

}

But if the second sound is {s r}, the {s visarga} disappears and the vowel
before it becomes long:

{ex

agniH rocate > [agnI] rocate
The fire is pleasing.

vAyuH rocate > [vAyU] rocate
The wind is pleasing.

dvAH (dvAr) rocate > [dvA] rocate
The door is pleasing.

}


{h {s sa} and {s eSa}}

The words {s saH} ("he," "that one") and {s eSaH} ("he," "this") are very
common in Sanskrit.  They have their own unique {s visarga} changes. But
thankfully, those changes are simple. In front of {s a}, they behave as you
would expect: 

{ex

saH acintayat > [so ']cintayat
He thought.

eSaH apazyat > [eSo ']pazyat
He saw.

}

But in front of {em all} other sounds, the {s visarga} disappears:

{ex

saH icchati > [sa] icchati
He wants.

saH cintayati > [sa] cintayati
He thinks.

eSaH pazyati > [eSa] pazyati
He sees.

}


{h Review}

You do not need to memorize the rules above. But if you would like to practice
using them, you can try to apply the correct {s visarga} sandhi changes to the
examples below:

{ex

rAmaH gacchati.

narAH gacchanti.

naraH azvam pazyati.

saH rAmaM pazyati.

guruH asti.

}
