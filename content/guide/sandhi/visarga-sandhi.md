{title {s visarga} sandhi}

{dfn {s visarga} sandhi} is the name for sandhi changes where the first sound
is the {s visarga}. Here is a simple example of {s visarga} sandhi:

{ex

rAmaH yoddhum icchati > [rAmo] yoddhum icchati.
Rama wants to fight.

}

Many Sanskrit words end in the {s visarga}, so {s visarga} sandhi is very
common.


{h Where does the {s visarga} come from?}

The {s visarga} itself comes from a sandhi change. {s s} and {s r} become the
{s visarga} when they appear at the end of a word:

{ex

rAmas > rAmaH
Rama

mAtar > mAtaH
mother!

}

Most of the {s visarga}s you see will come from {s s}. A very small number will
come from {s r}. If the {s visarga} comes from {s r}, its sandhi rules have
some small differences. So it is important for us to know which sound the {s
visarga} comes from.


{h Common changes}

Some changes are common and apply to all {s visarga} sounds.

If the second sound is unvoiced, the {s visarga} will match its point of pronunciation, if possible:

{ex

bAlaH carati > [bAlaz] carati
The boy walks.

bAlaH tiSThati > [bAlas] tiSThati
The boy stands.

}

These changes may even occur in front of {s za}, {s Sa}, and {s sa}. But these changes are usually not written down:

{ex

naraH zilAM gacchati (narazzilAM gacchati)
The man goes to the rock.

naraH SaNDaM gacchati (naraSSaNDaM gacchati)
The man goes to the thicket.

naraH sAgaraM gacchati (narassAgaraM gacchati)
The man goes to the ocean.

{h {s -As} sandhi}

The rules here are about words that originally end in {s -As}. In this context,
the {s visarga} disappears before any voiced sound:

{ex

narAH udakam pibanti > [narA] udakaM pibanti
The men drink water.

narAH madyam pibanti > [narA] madyaM pibanti
The men drink wine.

narAH vamanti > [narA] vamanti.
The men vomit.

}


{h {s -as} sandhi}

The rules here are about words that originally end in {s -as}. In this context,
{s -aH} becomes {s -o} in front of voiced consonants:

{ex

naraH madyaM pibati > [naro] madyaM pibati
The man drinks wine.

}

And if the second sound is {s a}, then we replace all three sounds with {s o}:

{ex

naraH amRtaM pibati > [naro ']mRtaM pibati
The man drinks nectar.

}

The {s '} symbol, which is called the {s-dfn avagraha}, often shows that a
vowel was removed due to sandhi.

Otherwise, the {s visarga} disappears before other vowels, just as we saw with
{s -As} above:

{ex

naraH udakam pibati > [nara] udakaM pibati
The man drinks water.

naraH odanam icchati > [nara] odanam icchati
The man wants rice.


}


{h Other changes}

Otherwise, the {s visarga} becomes {s r} in front of any voiced sound:

{ex

agniH asti > [agnir] asti
There is a fire.

vAyuH asti > [vAyur] asti
There is wind.

dvAH (dvAr) asti > [dvAr] asti
There is a door.

}

But if the second sound is {s r}, the {s visarga} disappears and the vowel
before it becomes long:

{ex

agniH rocate > [agnI] rocate
The fire is pleasing.

vAyuH rocate > [vAyU] rocate
The wind is pleasing.

dvAH (dvAr) rocate > [dvA] rocate
The door is pleasing.

}


{h {s sa} and {s eSa}}

The words {s saH} ("he," "that one") and {s eSaH} ("he," "this") are very
common in Sanskrit.  They have their own unique {s visarga} changes. But
thankfully, those changes are simple. In front of {s a}, they behave as you
would expect: 

{ex

saH acintayat > [so ']cintayat
He thought.

eSaH apazyat > [eSo ']pazyat
He saw.

}

But in front of {em all} other sounds, the {s visarga} disappears:

{ex

saH icchati > [sa] icchati
He wants.

saH cintayati > [sa] cintayati
He thinks.

eSaH pazyati > [eSa] pazyati
He sees.

}


{h Review}

Many Sanskrit words end with a {s visarga}, and the {s visarga} changes often
due to sandhi. You do not need to memorize the rules above, but it is important
to recognize them so that you can tell where one word ends and another begins.

As you read more Sanskrit, you will eventually understand {s visarga} sandhi
instinctively. But if you would like to practice, you can try applying the
correct {s visarga} sandhi changes to the examples below:

{ex

rAmaH gacchati.

narAH gacchanti.

naraH azvam pazyati.

saH rAmaM pazyati.

guruH asti.

}
