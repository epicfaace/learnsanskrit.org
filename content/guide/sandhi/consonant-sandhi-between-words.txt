{title Consonant sandhi between words}
{aka {s vyaJjana-sandhi}, {s hal-sandhi}}

{dfn Consonant sandhi} is the name for sandhi changes between a consonant and
some other sound. Here is a simple example of consonant sandhi:

{ex

sItA vanam gacchati > sItA [vanaM] gacchati
Sita goes to the forest.

}

Consonant sandhi is complex. In this lesson, we will focus on the common sandhi
changes that occur between two words. These changes also apply between the two
words in a compound.


{h Reducing consonants}

Sanskrit has many consonants. But Sanskrit words end only in specific consonant
sounds. So we must first apply a few rules to make sure that our word ends in a
valid consonant sound.

Before we study the specific rules, let's first see some examples of what these
rules do. In the examples below, the words on the left don't follow the rules
and are not valid words. After applying the rules, we get the correct results
on the right:

{ex

agacchant > agacchan
they went

vAc > vAk
speech

diz > dik
direction

rAj > rAT
king

samidh > samit
(sacred) wood, kindling

naras > naraH
man

}

Now, here are the changes that we should apply to words ending in consonants.
First, a word is not usually allowed to end in multiple consonants. If a
word does end in multiple consonants, we keep only the first of those
consonants. You can see some examples of this below:

{ex

agacchant > agacchan
they went

pazyant > pazyan
while seeing

prAJc > prAJ
facing, opposite

}

There are rare exceptions, usually if the second-to-last consonant is {s r}:

{ex

Urj > Urj
strength, vigor (no change)

}

Second, consonants pronounced at the hard palate generally become {s k}. ({s J}
becomes {s G}.) A very small number of words, such as {s rAj}, use {s T}
instead:

{ex

vAc > vAk
speech

diz > dik
direction

prAJ > prAG
facing, opposite

rAj > rAT
king

}

Third, the remaining consonant becomes unaspirated and unvoiced if it has an
unaspirated and unvoiced version. In the first example below, {s dh} has an
unvoiced and unaspirated version {s t}, so it becomes {s t}. In the second
example, {s m} has no unvoiced or unaspirated version, so it stays the same:

{ex

samidh > samit
(sacred) wood, kindling

vanam > vanam
forest (no change)

}

Finally, {s -s} and {s -r} become the {s visarga}:

{ex

naras > naraH
man

dvAr > dvAH
door

}

Sanskrit words do not usually end in semivowels ({s ya ra la va}). So by the
end of this process, we are left with eight possible final sounds: {s k}, {s
T}, {s t}, {s p}, {s G}, {s n}, {s m}, and the {s visarga}.


{h Rules for {s k}, {s T}, {s t}, and {s p}}

{s k}, {s T}, {s t}, and {s p} use the same voicing as the sound that follows
them:

{ex

tat vanam > [tad] vanam

tat udakam > [tad] udakam

tat phalam > tat phalam

}

They also become nasal when the sound that follows them is nasal:

{ex

vAk na > [vAG] na

rAT na > [rAN] na

tat na > [tan] na

kakup na > [kakum] na

}

If the second sound is {s h}, then we usually get this change:

{ex

vAk ha > vA[g gha]

rAT ha > rA[D Dha]

tat ha > ta[d dha]

kakup ha > kaku[b bha]

}

Some learners find it helpful to see these changes in a table:

{sandhi-table
{tr {th {s k}} {th {s T}} {th {s p}}}
{tr {s-tds G | N | m} {th nasal sounds}}
{tr {s-tds g* | D* | b*} {th {s h}}}
{tr {s-tds g | D | b} {th other voiced sounds}}
{tr {s-tds k | T | p} {th unvoiced sounds}}
}

In the table above, * {comm *} means that the following {s h} shifts its point
of pronunciation to match the first sound.



{h Extra rules for {s -t}}

{s -t} changes frequently. If the next consonant is pronounced at the hard
palate (like {s ca}) or the roof of the mouth (like {s Ta}), {s -t} changes to
a sound with the same point of pronunciation:

{ex

tat citram > [tac] citram

tat jalam > [taj] jalam

}

If {s l} is the second sound, it becomes {s l}:

{ex

tat labhasva > [tal] labhasva
Obtain that.

}

And if the next sound is {s z}, we get this change:

{ex

tat zocanti > [tac cho]canti

}

As before, some learners find it helpful to see these changes in a table:

{sandhi-table
{tr {th {s t}}}
{tr {s-td n} {th nasal sound}}
{tr {s-td c} {th {s c, ch}}}
{tr {s-td j} {th {s j, jh}}}
{tr {s-td T} {th {s T, Th}}}
{tr {s-td D} {th {s D, Dh}}}
{tr {s-td l} {th {s l}}}
{tr {td {s c} ({s z} becomes {s ch})} {th {s z}}}
{tr {td {s d} ({s h} becomes {s dh})} {th {s h}}}
{tr {td {s d}} {th other voiced sounds}}
{tr {td {s t}} {th other sounds}}
}


{h Rules for {s -n}}

Like {s -t}, {s -n} changes often.  If the next consonant is a voiced consonant
at the hard palate (like {s ja}) or the roof of the mouth (like {s Na}), {s -n}
changes to the nasal sound with the same point of pronunciation:

{ex

narAn jayAmi > [narAJ] jayAmi

}

If {s l} is the second sound, it becomes a nasal {s l}:

{ex

tAn labhante > [tA~l] labhante

}

In front of {s c/ch}, {s T/Th}, or {s t/th}, {s n} becomes {s Mz}, {s MS}, and
{s ms} respectively:

{ex

tAn caranti > [tAMz] caranti

tAn taranti > [tAMs] taranti

}

And if the next sound is {s z}, two different outcomes are possible:

{ex

tAn zocanti > [tAJ] zocanti
(option 1)

tAn zocanti > [tAJ cho]canti
(option 2)

}

Again, some learners find it helpful to see these changes in a table:

{sandhi-table
{tr {th {s n}}}
{tr {s-td Mz} {th {s c, ch}}}
{tr {s-td J} {th {s j, jh}}}
{tr {s-td MS} {th {s T, Th}}}
{tr {s-td N} {th {s D, Dh}}}
{tr {s-td Ms} {th {s t, th}}}
{tr {td nasal {s l}} {th {s l}}}
{tr {td {s J} ({s z} optionally becomes {s ch})} {th {s z}}}
{tr {s-td n} {th other sounds}}
}

{aside

{h Why {s Ms}?}

Are you surprised that {s -n} might become {s -Ms}? This strange change
has a reasonable explanation. Many of the Sanskrit words that end in {s -n}
originally ended in {s -ns}. After we reduce consonants, only {s -n} remains.
But if certain unvoiced sounds follow, we keep that {s -s} sound. Then the {s
-s} changes according to normal sandhi rules.

}


{h Rules for {s -m}}

{s -m} becomes the {s anusvAra} when consonants follow:

{ex

sItA vanam gacchati > sItA [vanaM] gacchati

}

And it may optionally become the nasal sound that matches the following
consonant:

{ex

phalam carAmi > [phalaJ] carAmi

phalam khAdAmi > [phalaG] khAdAmi

}

In modern times, this change is usually not written down. But, it is often used
in spoken Sanskrit.


{h Rules for the {s visarga}}

We learned about {s visarga} sandhi already. Please see the previous lesson for
details.


{h Review}

There are many small details to consonant sandhi. But this lesson is a complete
summary of its most common patterns.
