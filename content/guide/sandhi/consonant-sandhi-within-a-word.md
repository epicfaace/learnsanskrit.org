{title Consonant sandhi within a word}

In the previous lesson, we learned that consonant sandhi can occur between two
different words:

{ex

tat icchAmi > tad icchAmi.
I want that.

}

Consonant sandhi also occurs within a single word:

{ex

marut + bhiH > marudbhiH
by the winds

}

Consonant sandhi {em within a word} is complex and complicated. In this lesson,
we will explain some of its general patterns.


{h General changes}

If the second sound is a vowel, nasal sound, or semivowel, there are usually no
sandhi changes:

{ex

vac + anti > vacanti

vac + mi > vacmi

vAc + ya > vAcya

}

Otherwise, consonant sandhi within a word generally the same principles we
learned about in the previous lesson.


{h Preserving aspirated sounds}

One important difference is that we should preserve aspirated sounds if
possible. This idea is difficult to explain, but it is easy to understand:

{ex

budh + ta > buddha
(aspiration moves to `ta)

labh + ta > labdha
(aspiration moves to `ta)

bodh + sya > bhotsya
(aspiration moves to the first consonant)

dah + sya > dhakSya
(aspiration moves to the first consonant)

}

But sometimes, there is no sound we can move the aspiration to. In these
instances, we remove the aspiration completely:

{ex

muh > mokSyati
be deluded > will be deluded

}

These kinds of changes can occur even at the end of an expression:

{ex

dah > dhak
burning
(`d becomes `dh)

muh > muk
deluding
(`m stays the same.)

}


{h {s n} &rarr; {s N}}

In Sanskrit, {s n} often shifts its point of pronunciation and becomes {s N}:

{ex

gurunA > guru[NA]

viSena > viSe[Na]

}

Generally, the sounds {s r} and {s S} change {s n} to {s N}. This change can
occur even if the two sounds are separated by other sounds:

{ex

rAmena > rAme[Na]

rAmAyana > rAmAya[Na]

varSabhogyena > varSabhogye[Na]

}

Which sounds can come in between? Generally, any sound that we can pronounce
without moving our tongue very much can come in between. These sounds include:

{ul
    {li all vowels}
    {li {s y} and {s v}}
    {li consonants pronounced with the soft palate ({s k kh g gh G h})}
    {li consonants pronounced with the lips ({s p ph b bh m})}
}

There are many exceptions and subtleties to this rule. For now, just remember
that {s n} often changes to {s N} if it follows {s r} or {s S}.


{h {s s} &rarr; {s S}}

Likewise, {s s} often shifts and becomes {s S}:

{ex

agni + su > agni[Su]

dhanus + A > dhanu[SA]

}

Generally, any vowel other than {s a} or {s A} changes the following {s s} to
{s S}. The consonant {s k} can cause this change too:

{ex

vAk + su > vA[kSu]

}

In English, this change is sometimes called the {dfn ruki rule} because it is
caused by "r" sounds ({s R RR}), "u" sounds ({s u U o au}), "k" sounds ({s
k}), and "i" sounds ({s i I e ai}).

There are many exceptions and subtleties to this rule. For now, just remember
that {s s} often changes to {s S} if it follows "ruki" sounds.
