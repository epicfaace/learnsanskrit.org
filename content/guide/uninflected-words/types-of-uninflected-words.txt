{title Types of uninflected words}

In Sanskrit, we often modify a word's sounds to change its meaning. We often
modify both verbs:

{ex

gam > gamiSyasi
go > You will go.

}

And nominals:

{ex

nara > nareSu
man > among the men

}

These kinds of changes are called {dfn inflection}. Sanskrit uses inflection
extensively, so it is sometimes called a {em highly inflected} language.

Sanskrit also has a large class of words that we can call {dfn uninflected
words} {sa-opt avyayAni "unchanging"}, sometimes also called {dfn
indeclinables} in English. These words are "fixed" in a way that nominals and
verbs are not. Uninflected words can still go through sandhi changes, but
otherwise, they always stay the same:

{ex

tvaM [na] gacchasi.
You do [not] go.

ahaM [na] gamiSyAmi.
I will [not] go.

gajA [na] gaccheyuH.
The elephants might [not] go.

}


{h Types of uninflected words}

There are a few important categories of uninflected words.

First are what we might call {dfn prepositions}. In English, this term refers
to words like "over," "under," "around," and so on. In Sanskrit, this term
refers to words that are usually used as verb prefixes:

{ex

gacchanti > [A]gacchanti
They go. > They come ("go [here]").

gacchanti > [saM]gacchanti
They go. > They meet ("go [together]").

}

Prepositions are part of a larger class of words call {s-dfn nipAtAH}, which
are miscellaneous words:

{ex

rAmaH sItA [ca]
Rama [and] Sita

[he] rAma tvaM kutra?
[Hey] Rama! Where are you?

}

Finally, we have {dfn adverbs}, which modify the verb in some way. Many of them
are created from adjectives:

{ex

manda > [mandam]
slow > [slowly]

}
