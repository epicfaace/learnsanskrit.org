{title Other prefixes}


The {s upasarga} is the most common type of verb prefix. But there are other
verb prefixes that we can use with a verb, too. In this lesson, we will learn
about some of these prefixes.


{h {s gati}}

There is a miscellaneous group of prefixes called {s-dfn gati}. Usually, these
prefixes are used only with specific roots. Here are some common {s gati}
prefixes:

{ex

karoti > alaMkaroti
does, makes > decorates, adorns

karoti > satkaroti
does, makes > honors, respects

karoti > namaskaroti
does, makes > honors, venerates

gacchati > antargacchati
goes > "goes within"; disappears

bhavati > Avirbhavati
becomes > becomes apparent or manifest

}

{h {s -sAt}}

In addition to the prefixes we have seen so far, we can also turn {em nominals}
into verb prefixes.

We can create one type of nominal prefix by adding {s -sAt} to the end of the
nominal stem. Usually, we use this prefix with the words {s kR} ("do, make") or
{s bhU} ("become").

{ex

karoti > bhasmasAtkaroti
does, makes > turns (something else) to ash

bhavati > bhasmasAdbhavati
is, becomes > becomes ash

}


{h {s cvi}}

There is one more type of nominal prefix worth knowing. This type is quite
common:

{ex

kRSNa > [kRSNI]karoti
black > (someone) [makes black]

kRSNa > [kRSNI]bhavati
black > (someone) [becomes black]

}


In traditional grammar, these prefixes are called {s-dfn cvi}. (The word {s
cvi} has a complex technical meaning that is difficult to explain.)

Roughly, here is how we create a {s cvi} prefix. The last {s a} or {s i} of
the nominal stem becomes {s I}:

{ex

kRSNa > [kRSNI]karoti
black > (someone) makes black

zuci > [zucI]karoti
clear, bright > (someone) makes clear

}

The last {s u} becomes {s U}:

{ex

pazu > [pazU]karoti
beast, animal > (someone) makes (someone else) a beast or animal

}

And the last {s R} becomes {s rI}:

{ex

mAtR > [mAtrI]karoti
mother > (someone) makes (someone else their) mother

}
