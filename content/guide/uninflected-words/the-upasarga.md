{title The {s upasarga}}
{aka the preverb, the preposition, the verb prefix}

In traditional grammar, verb prefixes are considered a type of uninflected
word. We learned about several different verb prefixes in the core lessons:

{ex

gacchanti > [samA]gacchanti
they go > they come together; they convene ("go [together here]")

}

These verb prefixes are part of a list of twenty special uninflected words.
When these words are used as verb prefixes, they are called {s-dfn upasarga}s.
But these words have other meanings and uses, too.

{h How to use an {s upasarga}}

An {s upasarga} usually does one of three things. First, it might change the
root's meaning in a straightforward way:

{ex

gacchanti > [saM]gacchanti
they go > they meet ("go [together]")

nayanti > [saM]nayanti
they lead > They unite ("lead (others) [together]")


}

Second, it might create a totally new meaning. This new meaning usually depends
on cultural context:

{ex

gacchanti > [ava]gacchanti
they go > they understand

}

Third, it might intensify the root's basic meaning or leave it unchanged:

{ex

jayati > [vi]jayati
they conquer > they (intensely or fully) conquer

}

We can also use multiple {s upasarga}s at a time:

{ex

gacchanti > [samA]gacchanti
they go > they come together; they convene ("go [together here]")

nayanti > [samA]nayanti
they lead > they gather ("lead [together here]")

}

Many Sanskrit verbs use the prefix {s a-}. When we use an {s upasarga}, we
place it {em before} this {s a-}:

{ex

A + agacchan > Agacchan
They came.

pari + agacchan > paryagacchan
They went around.

}

In older Sanskrit, the {s upasarga} is a more independent word and can appear
almost anywhere in the sentence. But in later Sanskrit, the {s upasarga}
usually combines with the verb and creates a single word.


{h Other uses of these words}

Some of these words can be used independently of any verb. Here are some common
examples.

{s api} has the sense of "also" or "even" when it follows a word:

{ex

rAmo vanaM gacchati. lakSmaNo ['pi] vanaM gacchati.
Rama goes to the forest. Lakshmana [also] goes to the forest.

}

{s api} can also be used to ask simple yes/no questions:

{ex

[api] tvaM sukhinI.
Are you happy?

}

Another common example is {s prati}. It can be used with a noun in case 2 like
so:

{ex

rAmaM [prati]
regarding Rama, ...

tat [prati]
regarding that, ...

}
