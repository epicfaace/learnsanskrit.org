{title {s -ai}, {s -o}, and {s -au} stems}

There are only a few stems that end in the vowels {s -ai}, {s -o}, or {s -au}.
They generally use the basic nominal endings we've seen.


{h {s -ai} stems}

The main example of an {s -ai} stem is the masculine stem {s rai}, which means
"wealth" or "prosperity." If its ending starts with a vowel, it stays the same.
Otherwise, it becomes {s rA}:

{nominal

1 rAH rAyau rAyaH
2 rAyam rAyau rAyaH
3 rAyA rAbhyAm rAbhiH
4 rAye rAbhyAm rAbhyaH
5 rAyaH rAbhyAm rAbhyaH
6 rAyaH rAyoH rAyAm
7 rAyi rAyoH rASu
8 rAH rAyau rAyaH

}


{h {s -o} stems}

The two common {s -o} stems are {s go} ("cow") and {s dyo} ("sky", "heaven").
{s go} can be either masculine or feminine according to the animal's gender.
And {s dyo} is always feminine.

The {s -o} stems generally use the basic endings, but they make many small
changes, as well. You can see their endings below:

{nominal

1 gauH gAvau gAvaH
2 gAm gAvau gAH
3 gavA gobhyAm gobhiH
4 gave gobhyAm gobhyaH
5 goH gobhyAm gobhyaH
6 goH gavoH gavAm
7 gavi gavoH goSu
8 gauH gAvau gAvaH

}


{h {s -au} stems}

The main example of an {s -au} stem is the feminine stem {s nau}, which means
"boat." {s nau} uses the normal endings and uses normal sandhi changes.

We learned about the stem {s nau} when we studied the basic nominal endings.
But for convenience, we will repeat it here: 

{nominal

1 nauH nAvau nAvaH
2 nAvam nAvau nAvaH
3 nAvA naubhyAm naubhiH
4 nAve naubhyAm naubhyaH
5 nAvaH naubhyAm naubhyaH
6 nAvaH nAvoH nAvAm
7 nAvi nAvoH nauSu
8 nauH nAvau nAvaH

}
