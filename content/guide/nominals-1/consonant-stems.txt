{title Consonant stems}

{dfn Consonant stems} are the last of the major families of nominal stems.
As you might guess, these stems end in consonants.

Consonant stems use the basic nominal endings we saw earlier. But some
consonant stems have strong and weak versions that they use in front of
different endings, just as the {s -R} stems do. And since these stems end in
consonants, various sandhi changes might occur.

As a reminder, we use the strong stem in cases 1, 2 and 8 (except for the
plural of case 2) and the weak stem everywhere else.


{h Basic consonant stems}

Many consonant stems have strong and weak versions. But there also many that
use just one version for all endings. Let's quickly learn about these {em
basic} consonant stems, which use the same version with all endings.

Here are the forms of the masculine stem {s marut}, which means "wind." Apart
from some sandhi changes, all of these forms are regular:

{nominal

1 marut marutau marutaH
2 marutam marutau marutaH
3 marutA marudbhyAm marudbhiH
4 marute marudbhyAm marudbhyaH
5 marutaH marudbhyAm marudbhyaH
6 marutaH marutoH marutAm
7 maruti marutoH marutsu
8 marut marutau marutaH

}

Likewise, here are the forms of the neuter stem {s manas}, which means "mind."
All of these forms use the basic nominal endings:

{nominal

1 manaH manasI manAMsi
2 manaH manasI manAMsi
3 manasA manobhyAm manobhiH
4 manase manobhyAm manobhyaH
5 manasaH manobhyAm manobhyaH
6 manasaH manasoH manasAm
7 manasi manasoH manaHsu
8 manaH manasI manAMsi

}



{h {s -at}, {s -mat}, and {s -vat}}

Many of the words that end in {s at} are created with the suffixes {s-dfn -at},
{s-dfn -mat}, and {s-dfn -vat}.

{s at} is a root suffix. When we attach it to a root that means "X," we get a
stem that means "(someone who is) X-ing": 

{ex

pazyat
(someone who is) seeing

aham siMhaM [pazyan] dhAvAmi.
I, [seeing] the lion, run.

}

And {s -mat} and {s -vat} are nominal suffixes that mean "possessing X":

{ex

bhagavat
having glory or fortune; glorious, fortunate, blessed

hanumat
having (prominent) jaws; Hanuman

}

Generally, all of these stems use the same endings. The strong stem is {s
-ant}, and the weak stem is {s -at}.

Here are the masculine forms of the adjective {s bhagavat}, which means
"blessed" or "fortunate":

{nominal

1 bhagavAn-s bhagavantau-s bhagavantaH-s
2 bhagavantam-s bhagavantau-s bhagavataH
3 bhagavatA bhagavadbhyAm bhagavadbhiH
4 bhagavate bhagavadbhyAm bhagavadbhyaH
5 bhagavataH bhagavadbhyAm bhagavadbhyaH
6 bhagavataH bhagavatoH bhagavatAm
7 bhagavati bhagavatoH bhagavatsu
8 bhagavan-s bhagavantau-s bhagavantaH-s

}

As before, the strong stems are highlighted. Notice the long vowel in the case
1 singular ({s bhagavAn}) and the short vowel in the case 8 singular ({s
bhagavan}).

One small exception is that the case 1 singular of {s -at} is {s -an}, not {s
-An}:

{ex

hanuman > hanumAn
Hanuman (case 1 singular)

gacchat > gacchan
while going (case 1 singular)

}

Next, here are the neuter endings of {s bhagavat}:

{nominal

1 bhagavat bhagavatI bhagavanti
2 bhagavat bhagavatI bhagavanti
8 bhagavat bhagavatI bhagavanti

}

For the feminine, we usually use the endings {s -antI}, {s -vatI}, and {s
-matI}. We then use the normal endings for {s -I} stems.

{note
Roots in the {s hu} class will use {s -atI} instead of {s -antI}. What is the
{s hu} class? See our lesson on verb classes for more information.
}


{h {s -an}, {s -man}, and {s -van}}

These stems are formed with the suffixes {s-dfn -an}, {s-dfn -man}, or {s-dfn
-van}. The strong stem is {s -An} and the weak stem is {s -a}. But if the
ending starts with a vowel, we use {s -an}.

Here are the forms of the masculine stem {s Atman}, which means "self":

{nominal

1 AtmA-s AtmAnau-s AtmAnaH-s
2 AtmAnam-s AtmAnau-s AtmanaH
3 AtmanA AtmabhyAm AtmabhiH
4 Atmane AtmabhyAm AtmabhyaH
5 AtmanaH AtmabhyAm AtmabhyaH
6 AtmanaH AtmanoH AtmanAm
7 Atmani AtmanoH Atmasu
8 Atman-s AtmAnau-s AtmAnaH-s

}

Note that the case 1 singular is {s AtmA} and has no final {s -n} sound.

Here are forms of the neuter stem {s karman}, which roughly means "action":

{nominal

1 karma karmaNI karmANi
2 karma karmaNI karmANi
8 karma karmaNI karmANi

}

{note
Note the change from {s n} to {s N}, which is caused by a sandhi rule.
}


{h {s -in}, {s -min}, and {s -vin}}

These stems are formed with the suffixes {s-dfn -in}, {s-dfn -min}, or {s-dfn
-vin}. The strong stem is {s -in} and the weak stem is {s -i}. But if the ending
starts with a vowel, we use {s -in} instead.

Here are the forms of the masculine stem {s yogin}, which means "yogi":

{nominal

1 yogI-s yoginau-s yoginaH-s
2 yoginam-s yoginau-s yoginaH
3 yoginA yogibhyAm yogibhiH
4 yogine yogibhyAm yogibhyaH
5 yoginaH yogibhyAm yogibhyaH
6 yoginaH yoginoH yoginAm
7 yogini yoginoH yogiSu
8 yogin-s yoginau-s yoginaH-s

}

As above, note that the case 1 singular is {s yogI} and has no final {s -n}
sound.

Here are the forms of the neuter stem:

{nominal

1 yogi yoginI yogIni
2 yogi yoginI yogIni
8 yogi yoginI yogIni

}


{h {s -vas}, {s -ivas}, and {s -yas}}

{s-dfn -vas} is a root suffix. When we attach it to a root that means "X," we
usually get a stem that means "one who has X-ed." Some roots will use the
suffix {s -ivas} instead.

For {s -vas}, the strong stem is {s -vAMs} and the weak stem is {s -uS}. But if
the ending starts with a consonant, we use {s -vat} instead. {s -ivas} is
similar, except that its strong stem is {s -ivAMs} and we use {s -ivat} if the
ending starts with a consonant.

Here are the masculine forms of the stem {s vidvas}, which means "one who
knows" or "a wise person":

{nominal

1 vidvAn-s vidvAMsau-s vidvAMsaH-s
2 vidvAMsam-s vidvAMsau-s viduSaH-s
3 viduSA vidvadbhyAm vidvadbhiH
4 viduSe vidvadbhyAm vidvadbhyaH
5 viduSaH vidvadbhyAm vidvadbhyaH
6 viduSaH viduSoH viduSAm
7 viduSi viduSoH vidvatsu
8 vidvan-s vidvAMsau-s vidvAMsaH-s

}

Here is the same stem in the neuter:

{nominal

1 vidvat viduSI vidvAMsi
2 vidvat viduSI vidvAMsi
8 vidvat viduSI vidvAMsi

}

{s -yas} is a nominal suffix. When added to a nominal stem that means "X," {s
-yas} creates a stem that means "more X." Its strong stem is {s -yAMs} and its
weak stem is {s -yas}.

Here are the masculine forms of the adjective {s zreyas}, which means "better":

{nominal

1 zreyAn-s zreyAMsau-s zreyAMsaH-s
2 zreyAMsam-s zreyAMsau-s zreyasaH-s
3 zreyasA zreyobhyAm zreyobhiH
4 zreyase zreyobhyAm zreyobhyaH
5 zreyasaH zreyobhyAm zreyobhyaH
6 zreyasaH zreyasoH zreyasAm
7 zreyasi zreyasoH zreyaHsu
8 zreyan-s zreyAMsau-s zreyAMsaH-s

}

And in the neuter:

{nominal

1 zreyaH zreyasI zreyAMsi
2 zreyaH zreyasI zreyAMsi
8 zreyaH zreyasI zreyAMsi

}
