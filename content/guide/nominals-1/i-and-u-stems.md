{title {s -i} and {s -u} stems}

So far, we have learned about two different stem families. The first, which is
the family of {s -a} stems, contains masculine and neuter stems. The second,
which is the family of {s -A}, {s -I}, and {s -U} stems, mostly contains
feminine stems.

Now we will learn about the family of {s-dfn -i} and {s-dfn -u} stems. These
stems can be masculine, feminine, or neuter. That is,  they can appear in any
of the three genders.


{h Basic {s -i} stems}

In the examples below, we will use the adjective stem {s zuci}, which means
"shining," "clear," or "pure."

First, here is the pattern for masculine stems:

{nominal

1 zuciH zucI zucayaH
2 zucim zucI zucIn
3 zucinA zucibhyAm zucibhiH
4 zucaye zucibhyAm zucibhyaH
5 zuceH zucibhyAm zucibhyaH
6 zuceH zucyoH zucInAm
7 zucau zucyoH zuciSu
8 zuce zucI zucayaH

}

The endings here are mostly similar to the basic nominal endings. But there are
some important differences. For the singular forms, notice that cases 3 and 4
show slight changes. Case 3 has an extra {s n} sound, and in case 4 the {s i}
of {s zuci} strengthens to {s zuce}, which then combines by normal sandhi
rules:

{ex

zucinA zucaye
(`zuci, singular, in cases 3 and 4)

nAvA nAve
(`nau, singular, in cases 3 and 4)

}

In cases 5 through 8, we have various differences with no clear pattern:

{ex

zuceH zuceH zucau zuce
(`zuci, singular, in cases 5 through 8)

nAvaH nAvaH nAvi nauH
(`nau, singular, in cases 5 through 8)

}

For the dual forms, notice the long {s I} in {s zucI}. And for the plural
forms, notice that cases 2 and 6 resemble the {s -a} stems:

{ex

zucIn zucInAm
(`zuci, plural, in cases 2 and 6)

gajAn gajAnAm
(`gaja, plural, in cases 2 and 6)

}


Feminine stems follow a pattern similar to the masculine stems. But in cases 4
through 7, they can optionally behave as if they end with {s -I}:

{nominal

1 zuciH zucI zucayaH
2 zucim zucI zucIH
3 zucinA zucibhyAm zucibhiH
4 zucaye,zucyai zucibhyAm zucibhyaH
5 zuceH,zucyAH zucibhyAm zucibhyaH
6 zuceH,zucyAH zucyoH zucInAm
7 zucau,zucyAm zucyoH zuciSu
8 zuce zucI zucayaH

}

Note that the case 2 feminine plural is {s zucIH} as opposed to the masculine
{s zucIn}.

The neuter stem uses the basic nominal endings. But if an ending starts with a
vowel, we add an extra {s n} sound. We also use {s -InAm} with a long {s -I},
just as we did above:

{nominal

1 zuci zucinI zucIni
2 zuci zucinI zucIni
3 zucinA zucibhyAm zucibhiH
4 zucine zucibhyAm zucibhyaH
5 zucinaH zucibhyAm zucibhyaH
6 zucinaH zucinoH zucInAm
7 zucini zucinoH zuciSu
8 zuci zucinI zucIni

}

Again, notice that the neuter stem uses a long vowel with an extra nasal sound:

{ex

manas + i > manAMsi

phala + i > phalAni

zuci + i > zucIni

}


{h Basic {s -u} stems}

In the examples below, we will use the adjective stem {s madhu}, which means
"sweet." If used in the neuter gender, it can also mean "honey."

The masculine endings follow the same pattern as the {s -i} endings we saw
above. Where {s -i} becomes {s y} or {s ay} or {s e}, {s -u} becomes {s v} or
{s av} or {s o}:

{nominal

1 madhuH madhU madhavaH
2 madhum madhU madhUn
3 madhunA madhubhyAm madhubhiH
4 madhave madhubhyAm madhubhyaH
5 madhoH madhubhyAm madhubhyaH
6 madhoH madhvoH madhUnAm
7 madhau madhvoH madhuSu
8 madho madhU madhavaH

}

But note that the case 7 singular is {s -au} for both {s -i} stems and {s -u}
stems:

{ex

zucau
in the clean (thing)

madhau
in the sweet (thing)

}

The feminine endings are similar to the endings we saw above. This includes the
optional forms in the singular of cases 4 to 7, which might act like {s -U}
stems:

{nominal

1 madhuH madhU madhavaH
2 madhum madhU madhUH
3 madhunA madhubhyAm madhubhiH
4 madhave madhubhyAm madhubhyaH
5 madhoH,madhvAH madhubhyAm madhubhyaH
6 madhoH,madhvAH madhvoH madhUnAm
7 madhau,madhvAm madhvoH madhuSu
8 madho madhU madhavaH

}

Like before, note that the case 2 feminine plural is {s madhUH} as opposed to
the masculine {s madhUn}.

The neuter endings are again similar to what we saw above:

{nominal

1 madhu madhunI madhUni
2 madhu madhunI madhUni
3 madhunA madhubhyAm madhubhiH
4 madhune madhubhyAm madhubhyaH
5 madhunaH madhubhyAm madhubhyaH
6 madhunaH madhunoH madhUnAm
7 madhuni madhunoH madhuSu
8 madhu madhunI madhUni

}


{h Review}

If you are tempted to memorize these endings, we urge you instead to work on
acquisition.
