{title {s -A}, {s -I}, and {s -U} stems}

In the previous lesson, we learned about the {s -a} stems, which use masculine
and neuter endings. In this lesson, we'll learn about three very similar stems:

{ul
    {li The {dfn {s -A} stems} ({s-dfn AkArantAni}, "ending in {s -A}")}
    {li The {dfn {s -I} stems} ({s-dfn IkArantAni}, "ending in {s -I}")}
    {li The {dfn {s -U} stems} ({s-dfn UkArantAni}, "ending in {s -U}")}
}

Stems that end with these sounds are almost always feminine. In particular, the
{s -A} and {s -I} endings are often used as the feminine versions of stems that
end in {s -a}:

{ex

gaja > gajA
(male) elephant > (female) elephant

mRga > mRgI
(male) deer > (female) deer

}


{h Basic {s -A} stems}

In the previous lesson, we used the masculine stem {s gaja}, which means
"(male) elephant," to demonstrate the {s -a} stem. Here, we will use the stem
{s gajA}, which means "(female) elephant," so that the differences are clear.

As before, notice that the words in the singular use endings that are different
from the others we've seen. But the words in the dual and plural mostly use
endings that we've seen before:


{nominal

1 gajA gaje gajAH
2 gajAm gaje gajAH
3 gajayA gajAbhyAm gajAbhiH
4 gajAyai gajAbhyAm gajAbhyaH
5 gajAyAH gajAbhyAm gajAbhyaH
6 gajAyAH gajayoH gajAnAm
7 gajAyAm gajayoH gajAsu
8 gaje gaje gajAH

}


{h Basic {s -I} stems}

The {s -I} and {s -U} stems are similar to the {s -A} stems. But they have some
small differences in the singular. In the table below, we use the feminine stem
{s nadI}, which means "river":

{nominal

1 nadI nadyau nadyaH
2 nadIm nadyau nadIH
3 nadyA nadIbhyAm nadIbhiH
4 nadyai nadIbhyAm nadIbhyaH
5 nadyAH nadIbhyAm nadIbhyaH
6 nadyAH nadyoH nadInAm
7 nadyAm nadyoH nadISu
8 nadi nadyau nadyaH

}


The main difference is that the {s -A} stems frequently insert {s y} between
the stem and the ending:

{ex

gajayA > nadyA

gajAyai > nadyai

gajAyAH > nadyAH

gajAyAm > nadyAm

}


{h Basic {s -U} stems}

The {s -U} stems follow the exact same pattern as the {s -I stems}. Where {s
-I} becomes {s -y} and {s -i}, {s -U} becomes {s -v} and {s -u}. The only
meaningful difference is that the case 1 singular has an extra {s visarga}:


{nominal

1 camUH camvau camvaH
2 camUm camvau camUH
3 camvA camUbhyAm camUbhiH
4 camvai camUbhyAm camUbhyaH
5 camvAH camUbhyAm camUbhyaH
6 camvAH camvoH camUnAm
7 camvAm camvoH camUSu
8 camu camvau camvaH

}


{h Review}

{ol
    {li When a masculine {s -a} stem becomes feminine, which stem endings does
    it usually use?}
    {li The {s -U} stems use a {s visarga} in the case 1 singular. Do we use a
    {s visarga} in the case 1 singular of the {s -A} stems? What about the {s
    -I} stems?}
}
