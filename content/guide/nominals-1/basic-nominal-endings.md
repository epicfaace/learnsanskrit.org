{title Basic nominal endings}

In the previous lesson, we learned that we can sort nominal stems into
different families based on their last sound. Different stem families might use
different endings. For example, compare the endings we use with {s agni}
("fire") and {s manas } ("mind") below:

{ex

agni > agninA
with the fire

manas > manasA
with the mind

}

Here, we can see that {s agni} uses the ending {s -nA} and {s manas} uses the
ending {s -A}. But even though these endings are different, they both end with
a long {s -A} sound.

All stem families tend to use a set of {dfn basic endings}. Different stem
families will modify these basic endings in different ways. But if we know
these basic endings, we can more easily understand the system as a whole.

In this lesson, we will learn about the basic endings that Sanskrit nominals
tend to use.


{h Basic masculine and feminine endings}

Here are the basic nominal endings we use for the masculine and feminine
genders. These endings are the same for both genders:

{nominal

1 H au aH
2 am au aH
3 A bhyAm bhiH
4 e bhyAm bhyaH
5 aH bhyAm bhyaH
6 aH oH Am
7 i oH su
8 H au aH

}

The table above has eight rows and three columns. Each row corresponds to a
different case, and each column corresponds to a different number. For example,
we can use this table to learn that the "case 7 singular" ending is {s i}.

Why do we put these endings in a table? Is it so that we can sit down and
memorize these endings? No! In our view, that is a waste of time.

We use tables because they sometimes help us see certain patterns clearly.
Specifically, notice that many of these endings are the same. For example, the
same ending {s bhyAm} has three different meanings:

{ex

naro [gajAbhyAM] nagaraM gacchati
The man goes to the city [by means of the two elephants].

naro [gajAbhyAM] nagaraM gacchati
The man goes to the city [for the two elephants].

naro [gajAbhyAM] nagaraM gacchati
The man goes [from the two elephants] to the city.

}

How do we decide what {s bhyAm} means here? We can decide what {s bhyAm} means
only if we know the sentence's context. If we don't have that context, we must
guess.


{h Basic neuter endings}

The basic neuter endings follow an interesting pattern. In cases 3 to 7, they
are identical to the endings we saw above. But in cases 1, 2, and 8, they are
as you see below:

{nominal

1 _ I i
2 _ I i
8 _ I i

}

The "{dfn &mdash;}" symbol means that no ending is used. More importantly,
notice that all three of these cases use identical endings. This is the usual
pattern for neuter endings.


{h Two examples}

Let's study two examples of how to use these endings. We will study the
feminine stem {s nau}, which means "boat," and the neuter stem {s manas},
which means "mind."

When we add endings to the stem {s nau}, a few small sandhi changes apply if
the ending starts with a vowel. Otherwise, {s nau} is normal and predictable:

{nominal

1 nauH nAvau nAvaH
2 nAvam nAvau nAvaH
3 nAvA naubhyAm naubhiH
4 nAve naubhyAm naubhyaH
5 nAvaH naubhyAm naubhyaH
6 nAvaH nAvoH nAvAm
7 nAvi nAvoH nauSu
8 nauH nAvau nAvaH

}

Notice that {s nausu} becomes {s nauSu} due to sandhi. {s s} usually becomes {s
S} when it follows a vowel other than {s a} or {s A}.

Meanwhile, {s manas} is a neuter stem and uses neuter endings. As before, a few
small sandhi changes will apply. But otherwise, {s manas} follows a regular
pattern:

{nominal

1 manaH manasI manAMsi
2 manaH manasI manAMsi
3 manasA manobhyAm manobhiH
4 manase manobhyAm manobhyaH
5 manasaH manobhyAm manobhyaH
6 manasaH manasoH manasAm
7 manasi manasoH manaHsu
8 manaH manasI manAMsi

}

The {s s} in {s manas} becomes the {s visarga} if it is at the end of a word or
if the ending starts with a consonant. {s manaH} (with its {s visarga}) then
follows the normal rules of {s visarga} sandhi:

{ex

manas > manaH

manas + bhyAm > manas + bhyAm > manobhyAm

}

Notice that the word {s manAMsi} has a small stem change. The stem's last vowel
becomes longer, and we insert an {s anusvAra} as well:

{ex

manaH > manAMsi
minds

}

Neuter stems often change in this way. We will see many examples of this change
in the following lessons.


{h Review}

In this lesson, we learned about the basic nominal endings. We also studied two
examples that use these endings: the feminine stem {s nau} and the neuter stem
{s manas}. Finally, we learned that different stem families modify these basic
endings in different ways.

In the following lessons, we will learn how each stem family modifies these
basic endings.

{ol
    {li Why is it useful to know the basic nominal endings?}
    {li If we see a nominal ending that has multiple possible meanings, how do
    we decide which meaning is intended?}
    {li In the neuter gender, there are three cases that have identical
    endings. What are these three cases?}
