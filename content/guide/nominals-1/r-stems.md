{title {s -R} stems}

Our fourth stem family is the family of {dfn {s -R} stems}, which are usually
masculine or neuter. These stems mostly use the basic nominal endings. But
unlike the stems we have seen so far, these stems will {em change} in certain
cases and numbers. These changes occur only for the masculine stem.

For example, consider the stem {s kartR}, which means "doer" or
"maker." Suppose we use the stem {s kartR} in the masculine gender. In cases 1,
2, and 8 (except for the case 2 plural), the stem becomes {s kartAr} instead,
and the final {s -r} is dropped in the case 1 singular.

Many of the stems that end with consonants change similarly. These changed
stems are often called {dfn strong stems}, and the others are called {dfn weak
stems}. In the table below, all of the strong stems are highlighted:


{nominal

1 kartA-s kartArau-s kartAraH-s
2 kartAram-s kartArau-s kartRRn
3 kartrA kartRbhyAm kartRbhiH
4 kartre kartRbhyAm kartRbhyaH
5 kartuH kartRbhyAm kartRbhyaH
6 kartuH kartroH kartRRNAm
7 kartari kartroH kartRSu
8 kartaH-s kartArau-s kartAraH-s

}

As for the endings used by this stem, we have only a few comments to make. In
the singular, notice the use of {s kartuH} for cases 5 and 6. The case 7
singular, {s kartari}, uses the normal ending but with a different stem. 

In the plural, notice the use of {s kartRRn} and {s kartRRNAm}, which resemble
the other masculine endings we've seen:

{ex

kartRRn, kartRRNAm
(`kartR, plural, in cases 2 and 6)

gajAn, gajAnAm
(`gaja, plural, in cases 2 and 6)

zucIn, zucInAm
(`zuci, plural, in cases 2 and 6)

madhUn, madhUnAm
(`madhu, plural, in cases 2 and 6)

}

Finally, notice that the case 8 singular is {s kartaH}. Here, the original form
is {s kartar}, which becomes {s kartaH} due to sandhi. {s kartaH} and a word
like {s rAmaH} mostly follow the same sandhi rules. But where {s rAmaH} would become {s rAmo}, {s kartaH} becomes {s kartar}:

{ex

rAmaH nagaram gacchati > rAmo nagaraM gacchati
Rama goes to the city.

kartaH nagaram gaccha > kartar nagaraM gaccha
O doer, go to the city.

}

Here are the neuter endings for the {s -r} stems:

{nominal

1 kartR kartRNI kartRRNi
2 kartR kartRNI kartRRNi
8 kartR kartRNI kartRRNi

}

These follow the same kinds of patterns we've seen before.


{h Family words}

Many {s -R} stems refer to different family members. The four examples below
use the words {s pitR}, {s mAtR}, {s bhrAtR}, and {s svasR}:

{ex

dazaratho rAmasya [pitA].
Dasharatha is Rama's [father].

kausalyA rAmasya [mAtA].
Kausalya is Rama's [mother].

lakSmaNo rAmasya [bhrAtA].
Lakshmana is Rama's [brother].

rAmasya na [svasA].
Rama doesn't have a [sister].

}

Most of these words use {s -ar} instead of {s -Ar} for their strong stem:

{nominal

1 pitA-s pitarau-s pitaraH-s
2 pitaram-s pitarau-s pitRRn
3 pitrA pitRbhyAm pitRbhiH
4 pitre pitRbhyAm pitRbhyaH
5 pituH pitRbhyAm pitRbhyaH
6 pituH pitroH pitRRNAm
7 pitari pitroH pitRSu
8 pitaH-s pitarau-s pitaraH-s

}

The feminine stem {s mAtR} uses {s mAtRRH} in the case 2 plural. Otherwise,
it uses the same endings as {s pitR}:

{nominal

1 mAtA-s mAtarau-s mAtaraH-s
2 mAtaram-s mAtarau-s mAtRRH
3 mAtrA mAtRbhyAm mAtRbhiH
4 mAtre mAtRbhyAm mAtRbhyaH
5 mAtuH mAtRbhyAm mAtRbhyaH
6 mAtuH mAtroH mAtRRNAm
7 mAtari mAtroH mAtRSu
8 mAtaH-s mAtarau-s mAtaraH-s

}

However, {s svasR} uses the normal strong stem ({s svasAr}). Here are the cases
that differ from {s mAtR} above:

{nominal

1 svasA-s svasArau-s svasAraH-s
2 svasAram-s svasArau-s svasRRH
8 svasaH-s svasArau-s svasAraH-s

}
