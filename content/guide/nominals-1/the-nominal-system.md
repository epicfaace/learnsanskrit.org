{title The nominal system}

{dfn Nominals} are "naming" words. Along with verbs and uninflected words,
they are one of the three main types of Sanskrit word. We use the word {em
nominal} so that we can refer to many different types of words at once. These
types include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals.

In this lesson, we'll learn about the basic parts of a nominal word. We'll also
learn what kinds of meanings the different nominal endings can express.


{h Stems and endings}

Every nominal word has two parts: a {dfn stem} and an {dfn ending}. In the
examples below, we combine a stem with its ending to create a complete word:

{ex

siMha + [H] > siMhaH
the lion

siMha + [sya] > siMhasya
of the lion

siMha + [aiH] > siMhaiH
by the lions

}

The stem contains the nominal's basic meaning. And the ending expresses three
basic kinds of information: {dfn gender}, {dfn number}, and {dfn case}.


{h The three genders}

In the core lessons, we learned that Sanskrit nominals use three different
genders. These are the {dfn masculine} gender:

{ex

[siMho] gacchati
The [(male)] lion goes.

}

the {dfn feminine} gender:

{ex

[siMhA] gacchati
The [(female)] lion goes.

}

and the {dfn neuter} gender:

{ex

vanam asti
There is a forest.

}

Many nominal stems can freely use any of these three genders. But noun stems
generally use a fixed gender. Noun stems use a fixed gender even if they don't
refer to living beings:

{ex

yoga 
yoga (masculine)

nIti
wise conduct (feminine)

nirvANa
nirvana (neuter)

}

How do we determine which gender a noun should use? We can usually determine a
noun's gender by noticing the sounds at the end of a stem. Here are some
basic rules that might be helpful:

{ul
    {li Nouns ending in {s -a} are never feminine.}
    {li Nouns ending in {s -A}, {s -I}, and {s -U} are almost always feminine.}
    {li Nouns made with the {s -tra} and {s -ana} suffixes are usually neuter.}
}


{h The three numbers}

In the core lessons, we saw that Sanskrit nominals use three different numbers
{sa-opt vacana}. These are the {dfn singular}, which is used for one item:

{ex

[siMhaH] pazyati.
[The lion] sees.

}

the {dfn dual}, which is used for exactly two items:

{ex

[siMhau] pazyataH.
The [two] lions see.

}

and the {dfn plural}, which is used for three or more items:

{ex

[siMhAH] pazyanti.
The [(many)] lions see.

}

Verbs also use all three of these numbers. In a Sanskrit sentence, the verb and
the case 1 noun should have the same number.


{h The eight cases}

{dfn Case}, roughly speaking, is the name for the way that Sanskrit nominals
express different roles in a sentence. Sanskrit uses eight different cases.

{dfn Case 1} can be thought of as the {em default} case. Usually, it refers to
the subject of the action:

{ex

[siMhaH] khAdati.
[The lion] eats.

}

But this depends on the {s prayoga} of the verb. For example, consider the two
sentences below. Both use {s siMhaH} in case 1. But the meaning of {s siMhaH}
in each sentence is very different:

{ex

[siMhaH] khAdati.
[The lion] eats.
(`kartari `prayoga. The lion is the subject of the sentence.)

[siMhaH] khAdyate.
[The lion] is eaten.
(`karmaNi `prayoga. The lion is the object of the sentence.)

}

{dfn Case 2} is generally the {em object} of the action. It is also used for
destinations:

{ex

siMho [grAmaM] pazyati.
The lion sees [a village].

siMho [grAmaM] gacchati.
The lion goes [to the village].

}

{dfn Case 3} generally means "with" or "by means of":

{ex

siMho [mArgeNa] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [by means of the road].

}

{dfn Case 4} generally means "for" or "for the sake of":

{ex

siMho [mAMsAya] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [for meat].

siMhaH [khAdanAya] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [for eating] ("to eat").

}

{dfn Case 5} generally means "from," "than," or "because of":

{ex

naraH [vanAd] grAmaM gacchati.
A man goes [from the forest] to the village.

siMho [narAd] balavattaraH.
The lion is stronger [than the man].

naraH [bhayAd] gRhaM gacchati.
The man goes home [from (because of) fear].


}

{dfn Case 6} generally means "of":

{ex

siMho [narasya] gRhaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the house [of the man] (or, [the man's] house).

siMho [narasya] mAMsaM khAdati.
The lion eats the meat [of the man].

}

{dfn Case 7} generally means "in" or "on":

{ex

naro [siMhe] 'sti.
The man is [in the lion].

siMho [grAme] carati.
The lion walks [in the village].

}

And {dfn case 8} is the person being spoken to:

{ex

he [siMha] vanaM gaccha.
Hey [lion]! Go to the forest.

}

Here is what these cases are called in other resources:

{table
    {tr {th Our name} {th Sanskrit name} {th English name}}
    {tr {td Case 1} {td {s prathamA} ("first")} {td nominative case}}
    {tr {td Case 2} {td {s dvitIyA} ("second")} {td accusative case}}
    {tr {td Case 3} {td {s tRtIyA} ("third")} {td instrumental case}}
    {tr {td Case 4} {td {s caturthI} ("fourth")} {td dative case}}
    {tr {td Case 5} {td {s paJcamI} ("fifth")} {td ablative case}}
    {tr {td Case 6} {td {s SaSThI} ("sixth")} {td genitive case}}
    {tr {td Case 7} {td {s saptamI} ("seventh")} {td locative case}}
    {tr {td Case 8} {td (no special name)} {td vocative case}}
}

{aside

Why doesn't case 8 have a special name in Sanskrit? This is a very deep
question! For details, {url[r=vyakarana.index] see our {s vyAkaraNa-pravezaH}
series}.

{h Stem families}

Nominal stems can end with many different kinds of sounds:

{ex

siMha
(male) lion

agni
fire

manas
mind

}

We can group these stems based on the last sound they use. So we can talk about
{s -a} stems (stems ending in {s a}), {s -I} stems, {s -U} stems, and so on. We
use this grouping because stems with different final sounds tend to use
different endings.

For example, compare the endings we use for {s siMha}, (which ends in a short
{s -a}) to the endings we use for {s siMhA} (which ends in a long {s -A}).
These two stems use endings that are quite different:

{ex

siMha > siMhena
(male) lion > by the (male) lion

siMhA > [siMhayA]
(female) lion > by the (female) lion

siMha > siMhasya
(male) lion > of the (male) lion

siMhA > [siMhAyAH]
(female) lion > of the (female) lion

}

Roughly, we can combine all of these stem groups into five big {dfn stem
families}. All of the stems in a stem family tend to use similar endings.
These families are:

{ul
    {li the {s -a} stems}
    {li the {s -A}, {s -I}, and {s -U} stems}
    {li the {s -i} and {s -u} stems}
    {li the {s -R} stems}
    {li all other stems}
}

Stem families may have some small differences, but they generally share most of
their endings and follow consistent patterns.


{h Review}

In this lesson, we learned that nominals have two parts: a {em stem} and an {em
ending}. We also learned that nominal endings can express the following information:

{ul
    {li three different {em genders}}
    {li three different {em numbers}}
    {li eight different {em cases}}
}

Finally, we learned about different stem {em families}. Each stem family uses
slightly different endings.

In the next lesson, we will learn about the basic nominal endings. These
endings are common to all stem families, so they are important to know.
But before you continue, here are some questions for review:

{ol
    {li What are the three genders and the three numbers?}
    {li Give the basic meanings of each of the eight cases.}
}
