{title {s -a} stems}

In the previous lesson, we learned about the basic endings that nominal stems
use. Different stem families will change these endings in small ways.

Of all of the stem families, the one that changes them the most is the family
of {dfn {s -a} stems} ({s-dfn akArantAni}, "ending in {s -a}"). Stems in this
family are either masculine or neuter. 

Most of Sanskrit's nominal stems end in the vowel {s -a}, so it's important to
know this family well. Does that mean you should memorize these endings? No.
Just focus on their general patterns.


{h Masculine endings}

First, let's study the 24 masculine endings for the {s -a} stem. Let's use the
masculine noun stem {s gaja}, which means "elephant":

{nominal

1 gajaH gajau gajAH
2 gajam gajau gajAn
3 gajena gajAbhyAm gajaiH
4 gajAya gajAbhyAm gajebhyaH
5 gajAt gajAbhyAm gajebhyaH
6 gajasya gajayoH gajAnAm
7 gaje gajayoH gajeSu
8 gaja gajau gajAH

}

In the singular, the endings we use are very different from the basic nominal
endings. Here is a comparison:

{ex

manasA > gajena

manase > gajAya

manasaH > gajAt

manasaH > gajasya

}

Thankfully, the endings in the dual and plural are mostly similar to the basic
endings.


{h Neuter endings}

In the previous lesson, we learned that neuter endings and masculine endings
are usually very similar. For the {s -a stems}, the endings differ only in
cases 1, 2, and 8.

Here is the neuter noun {s phala} in cases 1, 2, and 8. In all other cases, {s
phala} uses the same endings as {s gaja}:

{nominal

1 phalam phale phalAni
2 phalam phale phalAni
8 phala phale phalAni

}

These words follow the basic pattern we learned about in the previous lesson.
Specifically, notice that the dual forms follow normal sandhi rules:

{ex

phala + I > phale

}

And that the word {s phalAni} lengthens its vowel and uses an extra nasal
sound, just as we saw with {s manAMsi}:

{ex

manas + i > manAMsi

phala + i > phalAni

}

However, one small change is that the singular of cases 1 and 2 uses the ending
{s -m}:

{ex

phala + m > phalam

}


{h Sandhi changes}

Some of the noun endings above use the consonant sound {s n}. If {s n} is not
at the end of a word, it might change due to a complex sandhi rule:

{ex

grAmena > grAmeNa
with the village

viSena > viSeNa
with poison

}

Roughly, the rule is that the letters {s r} and {s S} causes {s n} to change to
{s N}. This change can occur even if the two sounds are separated by vowels,
&ldquo;lip" consonants like {s p} and {s m}, and a few others.


{h Review}

{s a} is the most common vowel in Sanskrit, and the {s -a} stems are the most
common stem family. In the next few lessons, we'll learn about the other stem
families.

{ol
    {li Many of the endings used by the {s -a} stem have multiple meanings.
    Give an example of one of these endings. What meanings can it express?}
    {li In the {s -a} family, masculine and neuter endings are often identical.
    Which five cases are identical for both genders?}
