{title Modern pronunciation}


If you listen to modern Sanskrit pronunciation closely, you might hear certain
pronunciations that differ from the traditional descriptions. In this lesson,
we will describe some of these differences.


{h {s R}, {s RR}, and {s L}}

The ancient descriptions are clear that {s R}, {s RR}, and {s L} are vowel
sounds. Even so, modern speakers often pronounce these vowels like so:

{ex

kRSNa > kriSNa, kruSNa, krRSNa

pitRRn > pitrIn, pitrUn, pitrRRn

kLpta > klipta, klupta, klripta, klrupta

}

{s L}, especially, has many variants, perhaps because it is so rare.


{h The {s visarga}}

In modern times, the {s visarga} is often pronounced as an echo of the previous
vowel when at the end of a word or sentence:

{ex

muniH > munihi

taiH > taihi

nauH > nauhu

}


{h {s jJa}}

The combination {s jJa} often has these pronounciations:

{ex

vijJAnam > vigyAnam
(northern style)

vijJAnam > vigJyAnam
(southern style)

}


{h {s hna} and {s hma}}

The combinations {s hna} and {s hma} often have these pronunciations:

{ex

ahna > anha

brahma > bramha

}
