{title Vowels}
{aka {s svarAH} ("tones"), {s akSarANi} ("syllables"), {s ac}}

{dfn Vowels} are simple, open sounds:

{sounds-dr a-1}

By changing {s a} in different ways, we can create the full set of Sanskrit
vowels. In this lesson, we will learn about all of the ways we can modify this
vowel.


{h Point of pronunciation}
{aka {s uccAraNa-sthAna} ("pronunciation place")}

First, we can change the vowel's point of pronunciation. Sanskrit vowels use
five basic points of pronunciation:

{ul
    {li the soft palate}
    {li the hard palate}
    {li the edge of the roof of the mouth}
    {li the base of the teeth}
    {li the lips}
}

By using these five points of pronunciation, we can create five basic vowels:

{ul
    {li {s a} with the soft palate}
    {li {s i} with the hard palate}
    {li {s R} with the edge of the roof of the mouth}
    {li {s L} with the base of the teeth}
    {li {s u} with the lips}
}

{sounds-dr a-1 i-2 R-3 L-4 u-5}

Vowel that use just one point of pronunciation are called {dfn simple vowels}
{sa-opt samAnAkSarAni "simple vowels"}. If we use multiple points of
pronunciation, we create {dfn compound vowels} {sa-opt sandhyakSarANI "joined
vowels"}:

{ul
    {li {s e} and {s ai} with the soft palate and the hard palate}
    {li {s o} and {s au} with the soft palate and the lips}
}

{sounds-dr e o ai au}


{h Length}
{aka {s kAla} ("time")}

Second, we can change the vowel's {dfn length}. Most Sanskrit vowels are
either {dfn short} {sa-opt hrasva} and {dfn long} {sa-opt dIrgha}. Short
vowels are pronounced for one unit of time {sa-opt eka-mAtra "with one
measure"}, and long vowels are pronounced for twice as long as short vowels
{sa-opt dvi-mAtra "with two measures"}.

All of the short vowels, except for {s L}, have a long version:

{sounds-dr A-1 I-2 RR-3 U-5}

All of the compound vowels are already long, and they have no short form.

There is also a third length, {dfn protracted} {sa-opt pluta}, that is mainly
used in Vedic Sanskrit. All of the simple and compound vowels can be {s pluta}.
{s pluta} vowels are written with a {s 3} added to the end of them:

{sounds-dr a-1 A-1 A3-1}

So, we have the {s pluta} vowels {s A3}, {s I3}, {s U3}, {s RR3}, {s L3}, {s
e3}, {s ai3}, {s o3}, and {s au3}.


{h Nasality}
{aka {s AnunAsikyam} ("nasality")}

Third, we can make the vowel {dfn nasal} {sa-opt anunAsika} or non-nasal
{sa-opt an-anunAsika}. Nasal vowels are rarely used in normal Sanskrit.

{sounds-dr a-1 a~-1}


{h Accent}
{aka {s svara} ("tone")}

Fourth, we can change the vowel's accent {sa-opt svara}. In Vedic compositions,
accent is used extensively, but it does not appear anymore in standard
Sanskrit. There are three basic accents:

{ul
    {li {dfn {s anudAtta}} ("not raised") or {dfn grave}, which is a low tone}
    {li {dfn {s udAtta}} ("raised") or {dfn acute}, which is a high tone}
    {li {dfn {s svarita}} ("voiced") or {dfn circumflex}, which is mix of the
    high and low tones. But in many styles of Vedic chanting, the {s svarita}
    is instead a plain high tone that is higher than the {s udAtta}.}
}

Here are the three accents as they are written in Devanagari. From left to
right, we have {s anudAtta}, {s udAtta}, and {s svarita}:

{sounds-dr a_-1 a-1 a^-1}

The different Vedic accents and their pronunciation are out of scope for our
grammar guide.


{h {s -kAra} and {s -varNa}}

In English, we often say "the letter a" rather than just "a." Likewise, in
Sanskrit, we can add {s-dfn -kAra} to the end of any vowel to give it a more
usable name. Thus Krishna says in the {cite Bhagavad Gita}:

{comm TODO unsupported A in example English text due to expecting one node}

{ex

akSarANAm [akAro] 'smi
Of sounds, I am the letter `a.

}

We can also give names to certain vowel families. For example, {s a} has:

{ul
    {li three possible lengths (short, long, and protacted)}
    {li three possible accents ({s udAtta}, {s anudAtta}, and {s svarita})}
    {li two kinds of nasality (nasal and non-nasal)}
}

In total, this gives us 3 &times; 3 &times; 2 = 18 different variations on the
vowel {s a}. You can see all of them below:

{sounds-d a_-1 a-1 a^-1 a~_-1 a~-1 a~^-1}
{sounds-d A_-1 A-1 A^-1 A~_-1 A~-1 A~^-1}
{sounds-d A_3-1 A3-1 A^3-1 A~_3-1 A~3-1 A~^3-1}

We can refer to all 18 of these variations by the name {s-dfn avarNa} ("the {s
a} class"). Two sounds in the same {s varNa} are called {dfn similar} ({s-dfn
sa-varNa}, "of the same {s varNa}").

Just as we have {s avarNa}, we also have:

{ul
    {li {s-dfn ivarNa} for the 18 variations of {s i}}
    {li {s-dfn uvarNa} for the 18 variations of {s u}}
    {li {s-dfn RvarNa} for the 18 variations of {s R}}
    {li {s-dfn LvarNa} for the 12 variations of {s L}}
}

{s LvarNa} has only 12 variations because {s L} has no long version.


{h {s vivRta} and {s saMvRta}}

Let's dwell on {s a} a little longer. Have you noticed that {s a} is slightly
different from the other vowels?

{s i} and {s I} have similar pronunciations, except that {s i} is short and
{s I} is long. This is similarly true for the sounds of {s uvarNa}, {s RvarNa},
and {s LvarNa}. But although {s a} and {s A} are part of the same {s varNa},
{s a} is actually slightly different from {s A} and the other vowels.

Except for {s a}, all vowels are called {s-dfn vivRta} ("uncovered", "open")
because they are pronounced with the vowel cords uncontracted. {s a}, however,
is called {s-dfn saMvRta} ("covered," "contracted") because it is pronounced
with the vocal cords in a more contracted position.

To compare these sounds to English, we can say that all the sounds in {s
ivarNa} sound like the "ee" in "teeth" but with different modifications. But
although {s A} sounds like the "a" in "father," {s a} does not have that sound.
Instead, {s a} sounds like the "u" in "mud."


{h Review}

Each of the vowels {s a}, {s i}, {s u}, and {s R} has 18 different forms (3
lengths, 3 accents, and optional nasality). Each of the vowels {s L}, {s e},
{s ai}, {s o}, and {s au} has just 12 different forms, since {s L} has no long
form and the others have no short form.
