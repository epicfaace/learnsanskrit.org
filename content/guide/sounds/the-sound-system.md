{title The sound system}

Our core lessons already discussed the various Sanskrit sounds in detail.
Here, we will complete the basic picture those lessons painted. We will provide
much more detail about how to pronounce and describe these sounds. Where
appropriate, we will also provide the standard English and Sanskrit terms.

Traditionally, Sanskrit has these main points of pronunciation:

{ul
    {li the soft palate {sa-opt kaNThaH "throat"}}
    {li the hard palate {sa-opt tAlu}}
    {li the top of the roof of the mouth {sa-opt mUrdhA "head"}}
    {li the teeth {sa-opt dantAH}}
    {li the lips {sa-opt oSThau}}
    {li the nose {sa-opt nAsikA}}
    {li the base of the tongue {sa-opt jihvAmUlam}}
}

Some lists also include the chest {sa-opt uraH} as the source of the flow of
air.

In order, sounds pronounced with these points of pronunciation are called:

{ul
    {li {dfn velar} sounds {sa-opt kaNThya}, or {dfn guttural} in some old
    books}
    {li {dfn palatal} sounds {sa-opt tAlavya}}
    {li {dfn retroflex} sounds {sa-opt mUrdhanya}, or {dfn cerebral} or {dfn
    lingual} in some old books}
    {li {dfn dental} sounds {sa-opt dantya}}
    {li {dfn labial} sounds {sa-opt oSThya}}
    {li {dfn nasal} sounds {sa-opt anunAsika}}
    {li {dfn uvular} sounds {sa-opt jihvAmUlIya}}
}

Since {s va} is pronounced with both the teeth and the lips, it is called {dfn
labio-dental} {sa-opt dantoSThya}. And since {s o} and {s au} are pronounced
with both the soft palate and the lips, they are called {dfn labio-velar}
{sa-opt kanThoSThya}.

You do not need to remember any of these new terms. We list them here just for
your reference.
