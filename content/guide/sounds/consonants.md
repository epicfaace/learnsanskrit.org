{title Consonants}
{aka {s vyaJjanAni} ("embellishments"), {s hal}}

{dfn Consonants} are sounds that we pronounce by changing the basic flow of air
through the mouth. In Sanskrit, consonants use three different kinds of air
flow:

{ul
    {li {s-dfn spRSTam}: full contact at the points of pronunciation. Air no
    longer flows through the mouth at all. This applies for the sounds {s ka}
    through {s ma}.}
    {li {s-dfn ISatspRSTam}: slight contact at the points of pronunciation. Air
    flows through the mouth in a highly constricted way. This applies for the
    sounds {s ya} through {s va}.}
    {li {s-dfn ISadvivRtam}: loose contact at the points of pronunciation. Air
    flows through the mouth in a less constricted way. This applies for the
    sounds {s za} through {s ha}.}
}


{h {s ka} through {s ma}}
{aka {s sparzAH} ("contacted (sounds)")}

The first twenty-five consonants are often arranged in a square with 5 rows and
5 columns:

{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1}
{sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}
{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3}
{sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}
{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5}

For all of these sounds, the points of pronunciation make full contact with
each other. Thus they are called {s-dfn sparzAH} ("contacts"). In English
grammar, the nasal sounds are called {dfn nasals}, and the rest are called {dfn
stops}.

As a reminder, here is how these sounds are usually described:

{ul
    {li The sounds in the first and second columns are called {dfn unvoiced}
    {sa-opt aghoSAH}, and the others are called {dfn voiced} {sa-opt
    ghoSavantaH}.}
    {li The sounds in the second and fourth columns are called {dfn aspirated}
    {sa-opt mahAprANAH}, and the others are called {dfn unaspirated} {sa-opt
    alpaprANAH}.}
    {li The sounds in the fifth column are called {dfn nasal} {sa-opt
    anunAsikAH}.}
}

{h {s ya} through {s va}}
{aka {s antaHsthAH} ("in-between (sounds)")}

In Sanskrit, the four semivowels are called {s-dfn antaHstha} ("in-between"),
perhaps because these consonants are pronounced in a way that is in-between
vowels and other consonants:

{sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5}

Semivowels can also be nasalized. For example, the {s anusvAra} is pronounced
like a nasal {s y} when {s y} follows it.


{h {s za} through {s ha}}
{aka {s USmANaH} ("in-between (sounds)")}

The last four sounds are called {dfn sibilants} in English grammar and {s-dfn
USmANaH} in Sanskrit:

{sounds-dr za-2 Sa-3 sa-4 ha-1}

As a reminder, {s ha} is voiced. The other sounds here are not.


{h {s LLLa}}

In certain styles of Vedic recitation, a {s Da} sound between vowels becomes {s
LLLa}. And likewise, a {s Dha} sound between vowels becomes {s Lha}:

{sounds-dr LLLa-3 LLLha-3}

These consonants appear only in Vedic compositions.


{h {s -kAra} and {s -varga}}

As with the vowels, we can add {s-dfn -kAra} to the end of any consonant to
give it a more usable name. But {s ra} is called {s-dfn repha} ("snarl,"
"burr") instead:

{comm TODO unsupported ka in example English text due to expecting one node}

{ex

ka > kakAraH
ka > The letter ka

ra > rephaH
ra > The letter ra


}

We can also use the word {s-dfn -varga} ("group, division") to refer to
sets of consonants with similar properties. We have:

{ul
    {li {s-dfn kavarga} for the first five consonants ({s ka kha ga gha Ga})}
    {li {s-dfn cavarga} for the next five consonants ({s ca cha ja jha Ja})}
    {li {s-dfn Tavarga} for the next five consonants ({s Ta Tha Da Dha Na})}
    {li {s-dfn tavarga} for the next five consonants ({s ta tha da dha na})}
    {li {s-dfn pavarga} for the next five consonants ({s pa pha ba bha ma})}
    {li {s-dfn yavarga} for the semivowels ({s ya ra la va})}
    {li {s-dfn zavarga} for the sibilants ({s za Sa sa ha})}
}
