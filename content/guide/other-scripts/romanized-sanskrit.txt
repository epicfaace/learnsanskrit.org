{title Romanized Sanskrit}


The alphabet that we use in English is sometimes called the {dfn Roman}
alphabet. {dfn Romanized Sanskrit} is the general term for any Sanskrit text
that is written in the Roman alphabet.

Romanized Sanskrit became popular among Western scholars when they encountered
Sanskrit for the first time, and it became more established in the 19th
century. But even though that era has long passed, romanized Sanskrit is still
often used today. This is for a few reasons:

{ul
    {li If you can read Roman letters already, it's easy to learn and read
    romanized Sanskrit.}
    {li Romanized Sanskrit doesn't lose any information. That is, we can always
    convert it back to Devanagari or another script.}
    {li Romanized Sanskrit is often easier to use with computers.}
}

Today, it is easier than ever to display Sanskrit in Devanagari or another
Indian script. But even so, it is useful to know about romanized Sanskrit and
how to use it.


{h IAST}

The {dfn International Alphabet for Sanskrit Transliteration}, or {dfn IAST}
for short, became common among Western scholars in the 19th century. You can
see the IAST letters below:

{sounds-iast a A i I u U R RR L LL}
{sounds-iast e ai o au aM aH}
{sounds-iast ka kha ga gha Ga}
{sounds-iast ca cha ja jha Ja}
{sounds-iast Ta Tha Da Dha Na}
{sounds-iast ta tha da dha na}
{sounds-iast pa pha ba bha ma}
{sounds-iast ya ra la va}
{sounds-iast za Sa sa ha}


{h ISO-15919}

{dfn ISO-15919} is the modern standard for romanizing all Indian languages,
including Sanskrit. "ISO" stands for the International Standards Organization,
and "15919" is a numeric code associated with the standard.

IAST and ISO-15919 are largely similar. But they differ in a few letters:

{sounds-iso a A i I u U R RR L LL}
{sounds-iso e ai o au aM aH}
{sounds-iso ka kha ga gha Ga}
{sounds-iso ca cha ja jha Ja}
{sounds-iso Ta Tha Da Dha Na}
{sounds-iso ta tha da dha na}
{sounds-iso pa pha ba bha ma}
{sounds-iso ya ra la va}
{sounds-iso za Sa sa ha}
