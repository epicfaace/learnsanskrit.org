{title The Harvard-Kyoto system}

Devanagari and romanized Sanskrit use symbols that we can't find on a standard
computer keyboard. So it can be difficult to type either of these on a
computer. This is a problem because if we can't type Sanskrit, we can't write
Sanskrit content or use various Sanskrit tools.

One workaround to this problem is to define some way to {em map} English
letters to Sanskrit letters. In the examples below, the text on the left and
the right is the same. But the text on the left uses the {dfn Harvard-Kyoto
system}, and the text on the right uses either Devanagari or romanized
Sanskrit:

<ul class=examples>
<li>{code saMskRtA bhASA} &rarr; {d saMskRtA bhASA}</li>
<li>{code zrIbhagavAn uvAca} &rarr; {i zrIbhagavAn uvAca}</li>
</ul>

The Harvard-Kyoto system is one of the easiest mappings to learn, and it the
mapping that most Sanskrit tools and software expect. Here is how the system is
defined:

{sounds-hk a A i I u U R RR}
{sounds-hk L LL e ai o au aM aH}
{sounds-hk ka kha ga gha Ga ca cha ja jha Ja}
{sounds-hk Ta Tha Da Dha Na ta tha da dha na}
{sounds-hk pa pha ba bha ma}
{sounds-hk ya ra la va za Sa sa ha}
