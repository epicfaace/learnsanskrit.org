{title How to type in Sanskrit}

Sanskrit can be challenging to type because it needs symbols that we can't find
on a standard computer keyboard. Thankfully, there are several great solutions
that make it easy to type Sanskrit on a computer.


{h Transliteration software}

{dfn Transliteration} is when we convert one script into another. With the help
of transliteration software, we can first write Sanskrit using English letters
then use the program to convert our work into the script we want:

<ul class=examples>
<li>{code saMskRtA bhASA} &rarr; {d saMskRtA bhASA}</li>
<li>{code saMskRtA bhASA} &rarr; {i saMskRtA bhASA}</li>
</ul>

We are biased, but we recommend our own {url[r=tools.sanscript] Sanscript
program}, which has been one of the most popular transliteration tools for over
a decade.


{h Input method editors}

Transliteration software is convenient and easy, but there are more powerful
tools that are a little faster. {dfn Input method editors} convert what you
type into your desired script in real time. The downside is that they require
much more setup work. Here are our recommendations:

    {li For Windows users, we recommend
        {a[href=https://baraha.com/v10/index.php] Baraha}.}
    {li For Mac OSX users, we recommend
        {a[href=https://github.com/ratreya/lipika-ime] Lipika IME}.}
