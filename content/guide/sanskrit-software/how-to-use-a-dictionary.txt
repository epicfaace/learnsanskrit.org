{title How to use a Sanskrit-English dictionary}

A {dfn Sanskrit-English dictionary} lets you search for Sanskrit words and see
their definitions in English. If you plan to learn Sanskrit through English, a
good Sanskrit-English dictionary is invaluable.

There are two Sanskrit-English dictionaries worth knowing about. These are:

{ul
    {li V. S. Apte's {cite The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary}, which is
    especially clear}
    {li The Monier-Williams {cite Sanskrit-English Dictionary}. This is the
    main dictionary used by English-speaking Sanskrit scholars in the West.}
}

Both of these dictionaries were created in the 19th century. But thanks to the
{a[href=https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/] {cite Cologne Digital
Sanskrit Dictionaries} project}, both of these dictionaries are freely
available and searchable online.

In this lesson, we'll learn how to use the Cologne interface to search for
different words. Let's search for the following two words:

{ex

kRSNasya

akurvata

}


{h Step 1: Find the root or stem}

Sanskrit is a {em highly inflected} language. A nominal stem can use dozens of
different endings, and a verb root might have thousands of different forms.

Rather than store all of these forms, these dictionaries store just the
essential information. For verbs, they store the verb root. For nominals, they
store the nominal stem.

So our first step is to convert the words above to their stem and root forms.

{ex

kRSNasya > kRSNa

akurvata > kR

}


{h Step 2: Transliterate your word}

Many dictionary programs understand only a small number of different scripts.
The Cologne interface understands Devanagari and romanized Sanskrit. But if you
don't have an IME available on your computer, it is more convenient to enter
your search in Harvard-Kyoto:

<ul class=examples>
<li>{d kRSNa} &rarr; {code kRSNa}</li>
<li>{d kR} &rarr; {code kR}</li>
</ul>


{h Step 3: Search!}

By default, the Cologne interfaces expect Harvard-Kyoto and produce output in
Devanagari. If you like these settings, you can try searching for your word in
either
{a[href=https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/AP90Scan/2020/web/webtc/indexcaller.php]
the Apte dictionary} or
{a[href=https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2020/web/webtc/indexcaller.php]
the Monier-Williams dictionary}.


{h Final thoughts}

Once you get used to an online dictionary, it's difficult to go back to paper
books. With practice, you can quickly and accurately find the information you
need.
