{title {s asmad} and {s yuSmad}}
{aka personal pronouns}

{dfn Pronouns} are words like "I," "you," "he," "they," and so on. They can
often replace other nominal words:

{ex

rAmo nagaraM gacchati.
Rama goes to the city.

[sa] nagaraM gacchati.
[He] goes to the city.

}

We can often leave out a pronoun entirely if it is clear from context:

{ex

[sa] nagaraM gacchati.
[He] goes to the city.

nagaraM gacchati.
[(He)] goes to the city.

}

But even so, pronouns express many kinds of useful information.

In this topic, we will learn about the common Sanskrit pronouns. Pronouns use
many of the same endings as other nominals. But generally, they follow very
different patterns and must be learned individually.


{h {s asmad}}

First, let's consider the first-person pronoun {s-dfn asmad} ("I", "we"):

{nominal

    1 aham AvAm vayam
    2 mAm AvAm asmAn
    3 mayA AvAbhyAm asmAbhiH
    4 mahyam AvAbhyAm asmabhyam
    5 mat AvAbhyAm asmat
    6 mama AvayoH asmAkam
    7 mayi AvayoH asmAsu

}

There are a few points worth noting here. First, notice that {s asmad} does not
appear in case 8. Many pronouns appear only in the first 7 cases. Next, these
words use multiple different stems:

{ex

aham
I

mAm
me

AvAm
the two of us

vayam
me

asmAn
us

}

Also, notice that many of these words are similar to the words we use in
English:

{table
{tr {th Sanskrit word} {th English word}}
{tr {td {s-dr aham}} {td ego}}
{tr {td {s-dr mAm}} {td me}}
{tr {td {s-dr vayam}} {td we}}
{tr {td {s-dr asmAn}} {td us}}
}


{h {s yuSmad}}

{s-dfn yuSmad} ("you") follows the same general pattern as {s asmad}:

{nominal

    1 tvam yuvAm yUyam
    2 tvAm yuvAm yuSmAn
    3 tvayA yuvAbhyAm yuSmAbhiH
    4 tubhyam yuvAbhyAm yuSmabhyam
    5 tvat yuvAbhyAm yuSmat
    6 tava yuvayoH yuSmAkam
    7 tvayi yuvayoH yuSmAsu

}

Again, note that many of these words have English counterparts:

{table
{tr {th Sanskrit word} {th English word}}
{tr {td {s-dr tvam}} {td thou}}
{tr {td {s-dr yUyam}} {td you}}
}
