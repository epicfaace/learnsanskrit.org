{title {s tad}, {s etad}, {s idam}, and {s adas}}
{aka demonstrative pronouns}

The four pronouns {s-dfn tad}, {s-dfn etad}, {s-dfn idam}, and {s-dfn adas}
have similar meanings. In theory, here is how they differ:

{ul
{li We use {s etad} ("this") for what is near at hand}
{li We use {s idam} ("this") for what is slightly further away.}
{li We use {s adas} ("that") for what is much further away.}
{li We use {s tad} ("that") for what is not present.}
}

Below, we provide the forms for all of these pronouns in all three genders.

To get the forms for {s etad}, we add an {s e-} to the beginning of each form.
The only unusual changes are that {s saH} becomes {s eSaH} and {s sA} becomes
{s eSA}. These changes are due to normal sandhi rules:

{ex

sa khAdati > [eSa] khAdati.
He eats.

sA khAdati > [eSA] khAdati.
She eats.
