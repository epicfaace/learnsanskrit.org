{title Number words}


{dfn Number words} are adjectives that imply a specific number of items:

{ex

[paJca] pANdavAH
the [five] sons of Pandu

}

Sanskrit's number words generally follow the patterns of the stems we have seen
already. Many of these number words are the same regardless of the gender of
the noun they describe:

{ex

paJca pANdavAH
the five sons of Pandu (masculine)

paJca phalAni
five fruits (neuter)

paJca nadyaH
five rivers (feminine)

}

In this lesson, we'll learn about Sanskrit's number words and how to use them.


{h {s eka}}

{s-dfn eka} ("one") uses the normal pronoun endings. When {s eka} refers to one
item, it uses the singular. But {s eka} can also be used in the sense of "a
small number" or "a few" of something. When {s eka} has this meaning, it is
used in the dual and plural.

Here are the forms of {s eka} in the masculine gender:

{nominal

1 ekaH ekau eke
2 ekam ekau ekAn
3 ekena ekAbhyAm ekaiH
4 ekasmai ekAbhyAm ekaiH
5 ekasmAt ekAbhyAm ekebhyaH
6 ekasya ekayoH ekAnAm
7 ekasmin ekayoH ekeSu

}

{h {s dvi}}

{s-dfn dvi} ("two") is used only in the dual. The stem {s dvi} is used in
compounds and certain suffixes, but when we add endings, we actully use the
stem {s dva} stem (or {s dvA} for the feminine) instead.

Here are the masculine endings for {s dvi}:

{nominal

1 _ dvau _
2 _ dvau _
3 _ dvAbhyAm _
4 _ dvAbhyAm _
5 _ dvAbhyAm _
6 _ dvayoH _
7 _ dvayoH _

}


{h {s tri}}

{s tri} is always used in the plural. In the masculine, it uses the normal {s
-i} stem endings, except that the case 6 plural is {s trayANAm}:

{nominal

1 _ _ trayaH
2 _ _ trIn
3 _ _ tribhiH
4 _ _ tribhyaH
5 _ _ tribhyaH
6 _ _ trayANAm
7 _ _ triSu
8 _ _ trayaH

}

The feminine form of {s tri} uses the stem {s tisR} with the basic nominal
endings. But in the case 6 plural, it uses the ending {s -NAm} instead:

{nominal

1 _ _ tisraH
2 _ _ tisraH
3 _ _ tisRbhiH
4 _ _ tisRbhyaH
5 _ _ tisRbhyaH
6 _ _ tisRNAm
7 _ _ tisRSu
8 _ _ tisraH

}

Finally, the neuter follows the usual pattern of the {s -i} stems:

{nominal

1 _ _ trINi
2 _ _ trINi
8 _ _ trINi

}


{h {s catur}}

{s catur} ("four") uses the strong stem {s catvAr} in cases 1 and 8. Otherwise,
it generally uses the basic nominal endings: 

{nominal

1 _ _ catvAraH
2 _ _ caturaH
3 _ _ caturbhiH
4 _ _ caturbhyaH
5 _ _ caturbhyaH
6 _ _ caturNAm
7 _ _ caturSu
8 _ _ catvAraH

}

In the feminine, {s catur} uses the feminine stem {s catasR}. This stem is used
like {s tisR} above:

{nominal

1 _ _ catasraH
2 _ _ catasraH
3 _ _ catasRbhiH
4 _ _ catasRbhyaH
5 _ _ catasRbhyaH
6 _ _ catasRNAm
7 _ _ catasRSu
8 _ _ catasraH

}

The neuter endings are below. In this neuter form, we lengthen the last vowel
of the stem, but we don't insert a new nasal sound:

{nominal

1 _ _ catvAri
2 _ _ catvAri
8 _ _ catvAri

}


{h {s paJcan} to {s dazan}}

The numbers {s-dfn paJcan} ("five") to {s-dfn dazan} ("ten") use the same forms
regardless of gender.

The forms of {s paJca} ("five") are below. The stems {s saptan} ("seven"), {s
navan} ("nine"), and {s dazan} ("ten") all follow the same pattern as {s
paJcan}:

{nominal

1 _ _ paJca
2 _ _ paJca
3 _ _ paJcabhiH
4 _ _ paJcabhyaH
5 _ _ paJcabhyaH
6 _ _ paJcAnAm
7 _ _ paJcasu
8 _ _ paJca

}

{s SaS} ("six") follows a similar pattern, but the last {s S} of {s SaS} causes
many sandhi changes:

{nominal

1 _ _ SaT
2 _ _ SaT
3 _ _ SaDbhiH
4 _ _ SaDbhyaH
5 _ _ SaDbhyaH
6 _ _ SaNNAm
7 _ _ SaTsu
8 _ _ SaT

}

{s aSTa} ("eight") also follows a similar pattern, but it has some optional
forms that are more irregular:

{nominal

1 _ _ aSTa,aSTau
2 _ _ aSTa,aSTau
3 _ _ aSTabhiH,aSTAbhiH
4 _ _ aSTabhyaH,aSTAbhyaH
5 _ _ aSTabhyaH,aSTAbhyaH
6 _ _ aSTAnAm
7 _ _ aSTasu,aSTAsu
8 _ _ aSTa,aSTau

}


{h {s ekAdaza} to {s navadaza}}

You can see the numbers 11 to 19 in the examples below. All of them use the
same endings as {s daza}:

{ex

ekAdaza
eleven

dvAdaza
twelve

trayodaza
thirteen

caturdaza
fourteen

paJcadaza
fifteen

SoDaza
sixteen

saptadaza
seventeen

}

{h {s viMzati} to {s navati}}

catvAriMzat
forty

paJcAzat
fifty

SaSTiH
sixty

saptatiH
seventy

azItiH

}


{h {s zata} to {s koTi}}

ayutam
ten thousand

lakSam
