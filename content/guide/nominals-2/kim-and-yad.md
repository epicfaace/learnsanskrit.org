{title {s kim} and {s yad}}
{aka interrogative and relative pronouns}

The two pronouns {s-dfn kim} and {s-dfn yad} let us create different kinds of
complex sentences. In this lesson, we will learn more about what kinds of
endings these pronouns use.

{note If you want to focus more on what these pronouns mean and less on their specific endings, see our {it Sentences} topic.}


{h {s kim}}

{s kim} means "who?" or "what?" We use {s kim} to ask questions:

{ex

[kas] tvam.
[Who] are you?

tvaM [kasmai] phalaM dadAsi
[To whom] are you giving the fruit?

[kasmAt] rAvaNaH sItAm icchati.
For what reason ([from what]) does Ravana want Sita?

}

{s kim} uses the same endings as {s tad}, but its neuter singular form in cases
1 and 2 is {s kim}:

{ex

[kim] etat?
What is this?

}

Also, the masculine case 1 singular ({s kaH}) uses normal sandhi rules. Compare
the results below:

{ex

kaH yodhaH > [ko] yodhaH
Who is a warrior?

saH yodhaH > [sa] yodhaH
He is a warrior.

}

Just for reference, here are the forms of {s kim} in the masculine gender:

{nominal

    1 kaH kau ke
    2 kam kau kAn
    3 kena kAbhyAm kaiH
    4 kasmai kAbhyAm kebhyaH
    5 kasmAt kAbhyAm kebhyaH
    6 kasya kayoH keSAm
    7 kasmin kayoH keSu

}

the feminine gender:

{nominal

    1 kA ke kAH
    2 kAm ke kAH
    3 kayA kAbhyAm kAbhiH
    4 kasyai kAbhyAm kAbhyaH
    5 kasyAH kAbhyAm kAbhyaH
    6 kasyAH kayoH kAsAm
    7 kasyAm kayoH kAsu

}

and the neuter gender:

{nominal

    1 kim ke kAni
    2 kim ke kAni

}


{h {s -cit} and {s -cana}}

We can use the suffixes {s-dfn -cit} and {s-dfn cana} to create a word that
means "someone" or "something":

{ex

kaH pRcchati > [kazcit] pRcchati
Who is asking? > [Someone] is asking.

kena zrutam > [kenacana] zrutam
By whom was it heard? > [By someone] it was heard.

}


{h {s yad}}

{s yad} means "who" or "what," but not in the sense of asking a question.
Rather, {s yad} lets us join sentences together.

This idea is difficult to explain but easy to understand. In the examples
below, the first two sentences are simple. Then we use {s yad} to connect them.

{ex

sA pRcchati.
She asks.

sA rAmasya patnI.
She is Rama's wife.

[yA] pRcchati [sA] rAmasya patnI.
[Who] asks, [she] is Rama's wife. (literal translation)
The person [who] asks is Rama's wife. (natural translation)
(Note that we pair `yad with another pronoun here.)

}

We can create more complex examples too:

{ex

rAmaH tasyai phalaM dadAti.
Rama gives a fruit to her.

sA rAmasya patnI.
She is Rama's wife.

[yasyai] rAmaH phalaM dadAti [sA] rAmasya patnI
[To whom] Rama gives a fruit, [she] is Rama's wife. (literal)
The person [to whom] Rama gives a fruit is Rama's wife. (natural)

}

And even more complex examples:

{ex

rAmaH tasyai phalaM dadAti.
Rama gives a fruit to her.

tasyAH pitA janakaH
Her father is Janaka.

[yasyai] rAmaH phalaM dadAti [tasyAH] pitA janakaH
[To whom] Rama gives a fruit, [her] father is Janaka. (literal)
The father of the one [to whom] Rama gives a fruit is Janaka. (natural)

}

{s yad} uses the same endings as {s tad}, but it follows normal sandhi rules.
Here are the forms of {s yad} with masculine endings:

{nominal

    1 yaH yau ye
    2 yam yau yAn
    3 yena yAbhyAm yaiH
    4 yasmai yAbhyAm yebhyaH
    5 yasmAt yAbhyAm yebhyaH
    6 yasya yayoH yeSAm
    7 yasmin yayoH yeSu

}

feminine endings:

{nominal

    1 yA ye yAH
    2 yAm ye yAH
    3 yayA yAbhyAm yAbhiH
    4 yasyai yAbhyAm yAbhyaH
    5 yasyAH yAbhyAm yAbhyaH
    6 yasyAH yayoH yAsAm
    7 yasyAm yayoH yAsu

}

and neuter endings:

{nominal

    1 yat ye yAni
    2 yat ye yAni

}
