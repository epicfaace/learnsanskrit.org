{title Pronominal adjectives}

There are many adjectives that use the same endings as pronouns like {s tad}.
We can call these adjectives {dfn pronominal adjectives} since they are
adjectives that behave like pronouns.

Here are some common examples:

{ex

pUrva > [pUrvasmin] dine
previous > on the [previous] day

para > [parasmin] dine
next > on the [next] day

eka > [ekasmin] dine
one > on [a certain] day

anya > [anyasmin] dine
other > on [another] day

sarva > [sarve] narAH
all > [all] men

vizve > [vizve] devAH
all > [all] gods

}

But there is one small exception. Apart from {s anya} and a few rarer stems,
all of these pronominal adjectives use {s -m} in the neuter singular of cases 1
and 2:

{ex

ekam phalam
one fruit

sarvam udakam 
all the water

[anyat] phalam
another fruit

}
