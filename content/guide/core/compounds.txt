{title Compounds}

This is our last core lesson. Here, we will learn about {em compounds}, one of
Sanskrit's most notable features.

{dfn Compounds} are words that we make by combining multiple words. Compounds
are short and simple, and they save time for both the speaker and the listener:

{ex

gajAnAM vanam > gajavanam
the forest of elephants

}

Sanskrit uses compounds extensively. In some styles of Sanskrit, almost every
sentence will have a compound. And these compounds can also be quite long and
intricate.

In this lesson, we will learn about two basic types of compounds.


{h {s dvandva}}

In our first type of compound, we have two words that are in a list together.
Here are some English examples of this type:

{ul
    {li Indochina (India and China)}
    {li tractor-trailer (a tractor and a trailer)}
}

In Sanskrit, these compounds are called {s-dfn dvandva} compounds. The word {s
dvandva} literally means "pair." Any set of words that could be combined with
the word {s ca} ("and") can be combined into a {s dvandva}:

{ex

rAmaH sItA [ca] > rAmasIte
Rama [and] Sita

rAmaH sItA lakSmaNaH [ca] > rAmasItAlakSmaNAH
Rama, Sita, [and] Lakshmana

}


{h {s tatpuruSa}}

In our second type of compound, the first word describes the second in some
way. Here are some English examples of this type:

{ul
{li "wallpaper" (paper for a wall)}
{li "chessboard" (a board for chess)}
{li "beekeeper" (keeper of bees)}
}

In all of these compounds, the second word is the main idea, and the first word
modifies it. In Sanskrit, this kind of compound is called a {dfn {s
tatpuruSa}} compound.

Here are some Sanskrit examples of {s tatpuruSa} compounds:

{ex

rAmasya mAtA > rAmamAtA
Rama's mother

rAmasya putraH > rAmaputraH
Rama's son

rAmasya patnI > rAmapatnI
Rama's wife

}

The word {s tatpuruSa} ("his man") comes from the words {s tat} ("he, that
one") and {s puruSa} ("man"). So, the word "{s tatpuruSa}" is itself a {s
tatpuruSa} compound:

{ex

tasya puruSaH > tatpuruSaH
his man

}


{h Understanding compounds}

Compounds are easy to understand if we know their context. For example, the
word "wallpaper" probably has a clear meaning to you, and you might have even
seen or felt wallpaper before. But someone from another culture might create
interpretations like:

{ul
    {li "paper that is also a wall," as in "I built this house with wallpaper."}
    {li "paper that is on a wall," as in "I hung my diploma next to my other wallpapers."}
}

These interpretations don't occur to you because you know the cultural context.
You know what wallpaper is.

Many Sanskrit compounds are the same way. If you know their cultural context
and are familiar with them, they are easy to understand. If not, they can be
difficult to understand.

But what do we do if we don't understand the culture at all? Thankfully, there
are some basic rules of thumb that we can use to tell compounds apart. For
example, if the words in a compound are all names, or all foods, or all flowers
-- that is, if they all have the same "type" -- then the compound is probably a
{s dvandva}.

There are other basic rules we can use for the other types of compounds. We'll
discuss these rules in a later lesson. (But as always, the best way is to read
a lot of Sanskrit!)
