{title Syllables}

{dfn Syllables} are groups of sounds that we pronounce as one unit. For
example, a word like "beginners" has three syllables ("be-gin-ners"). Now that
we know about the basic Sanskrit sounds, let's learn more about syllables.

Why learn about syllables? First, knowing about syllables helps us have good
pronunciation. Second, some of Sanskrit's rules are easier to understand if we
know how syllables work.


{h How to split a phrase into syllables}

In Sanskrit, each syllable has exactly one vowel:

{ex

yoga > yo ga
yoga

vyAkaraNa > vyA ka ra Na
grammar

}

Traditionally, each syllable should end in a vowel:

{ex

dharma > dha rma
dharma

kSetra > kSe tra
field

}

And the {s anusvAra} and {s visarga} are in the same syllable as the vowel they
follow:

{ex

saMskRta > [saM] skR ta
Sanskrit

duHkha > [duH] kha
difficulty, suffering

}

If there are any other sounds at the end of our phrase, we include them in the
last syllable:

{ex

sukham > su [kham]
ease, pleasure

vRkSAt > vR [kSAt]
from the tree

}

To better understand these rules, let's read the first verse of the {cite
Bhagavad Gita}, which you can listen to
{a[href=https://youtu.be/vhoNZeR138k?t=50] here}. Here is the first half of the
verse:

{ex

dharmakSetre kurukSetre samavetA yuyutsavaH |

}

We split this into syllables like so:

{ex

dharmakSetre kurukSetre > dha rma kSe tre ku ru kSe tre

samavetA yuyutsavaH > sa ma ve tA yu yu tsa vaH

}

{h Devanagari: a syllable script}

In the examples above, notice how cleanly each Devanagari word separates into
different syllables. Each "unit" of Devanagari is its own syllable according to
the rules above.

{h Light and heavy syllables}

There are two kinds of syllables: {dfn light} and {dfn heavy}. We usually
pronounce heavy syllables for {em twice as much time} as light syllables.

Which syllables are light, and which are heavy? Generally, these syllables are
heavy:

{ul
    {li Syllables with long vowels.}
    {li Syllables that are followed by multiple consonants.}
    {li Syllables that are followed by the {s anusvAra} or {s visarga}.}
}

And all other syllables are light.

In the example below, the red syllables are heavy and the black ones are light.
As you read through this example, try to explain why each syllable is light or
heavy:

{ex

[dha rma kSe tre] ku [ru kSe tre]

sa ma [ve tA] yu [yu] tsa [vaH]

}


{h Review}

If you pronounce light and heavy syllables correctly, your Sanskrit
pronunciation will be sharp and clear.

If you would like to practice identifying syllables, you can try dividing the
lines below. The first line is from the {cite Puruṣasūktam}, which you can
listen to {a[href=https://youtu.be/KhVeK53KUDA?t=334] here}:

{ex

sahasrazIrSA puruSaH sahasrAkSaH sahasrapAt

}

The next line is from the {cite Veṅkaṭasuprabhātam}, which you can listen to
{a[href=https://youtu.be/krGYd5tZe0A?t=47] here}:

{ex

mAtaH samastajagatAM madhukaiTabhAreH

}

And the last line is from the {cite Mahiṣāsuramardinistotram}, which you can
listen to {a[href=https://youtu.be/8ibj8H4UdlY?t=20] here}:

{ex

ayi girinandini nanditamedini vizvavinodini nandinute

}
