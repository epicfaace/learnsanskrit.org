{title Short and long vowels}

In the previous lesson, we learned about five basic vowels:

{sounds-dr a-1 i-2 R-3 L-4 u-5}

These five vowels are like different ingredients in a kitchen. By combining
ingredients in different ways, we can create all kinds of new flavors. And by
combining vowels in different ways, we can create all kinds of new sounds.

In this lesson, we will learn about some of the new sounds we can create by
combining the basic vowels above.


{h Doubling a vowel}

Suppose we are drinking tea and want to make our tea sweeter. What is the
difference between adding one spoon of sugar and adding two? With one
spoonful, our tea will be sweet. With two spoonfuls, our tea will be very
sweet!

In the same way, what if we combine {s a} and {s a} together? We get a new
sound that has the same basic flavor as {s a} but in a more intense form. We
get the vowel {s A}:

{sounds-dr A-1}

{s A} is pronounced for twice as much time as {s a}. For this reason, {s A} is
called a {dfn long} vowel, and {s a} is called a {dfn short} vowel.

We will study many different sound combinations in our guide. So let's use this
simple format to describe them:

{ex

a + a > A

}

To the left of the arrow, you can see the two sounds that we combine ({s a} and
{s a}). To the right, you can see our result ({s A}). You can read this rule as
"{s a} and {s a} combine to make {s A}."

Can we combine the other vowels we've seen so far? Yes, we can:

{ex

i + i > I

R + R > RR

u + u > U

}

{s L} is very rare in Sanskrit, and it does not have a long version. So in
total, these combinations give us four new long vowels:

{sounds-dr A-1 I-2 RR-3 U-5}


{h Combining long vowels}

What happens if we try the combinations below? Do we get an "extra long" {s A}?

{ex

a + a > A

a + A > ?

A + a > ?

A + A > ?

}

No, we don't get an "extra long" {s A}. All of these combinations give us {s A}
again:

{ex

a + a > A

a + A > A

A + a > A

A + A > A

}

To save space and make the pattern clear, let's write down all four of these
changes like so:

{ex

(a, A) + (a, A) > A

}

Here, {s (a, A)} means "{s a} or {s A}." So you can read this rule as "{s a} or
{s A} combines with another {s a} or {s A} to create {s A}."

Likewise, here are the rules for the other vowels:

{ex

(i, I) + (i, I) > I

(R, RR) + (R, RR) > RR

(u, U) + (u, U) > U

}


{h Review}

We have now seen the first nine Sanskrit vowels. Here they are in their
traditional order:

{sounds-dr a-1 A-1 i-2 I-2 u-5 U-5}
{sounds-dr R-3 RR-3 L-4}

In the next lesson, we will continue to combine these vowels in different ways
and create new sounds. Now, here are a few review questions: 

{ol
{li Which vowels are short? Which vowels are long?}
{li What do we get when we combine {s A} and {s A}?}
{li What do we get when we combine {s i} and {s i}?}
}
