{title Compounds}

{dfn Compounds} are words that we make by combining multiple words. Usually,
we combine two words at a time. In English, we have compounds like:

{ul
{li "Indochina" (India and China)}
{li "wallpaper" (paper for a wall)}
{li "graybeard" (someone whose beard is gray)}
{li "songwriter" (writer of songs)}
}

Compounds are short and simple, and they save time for both the speaker and the
listener. This is part of the reason they are so common in Sanskrit.

In this lesson, which is our last core lesson, we will learn about two basic
types of Sanskrit compounds.


{h {s dvandva}}

In our first type of compound, we have two words that are in a list together.
Here are some English examples:

{ul
    {li Indochina (India and China)}
    {li tractor-trailer (a tractor and a trailer)}
}

In Sanskrit, these compounds are called {s-dfn dvandva} compounds. The word {s
dvandva} literally means "pair." Any set of words that could be combined with
the word {s ca} ("and") can be combined into a {s dvandva}:

{ex

rAmaH sItA [ca] > rAmasIte
Rama [and] Sita

rAmaH sItA lakSmaNaH [ca] > rAmasItAlakSmaNAH
Rama, Sita, [and] Lakshmana

}


{h {s tatpuruSa}}

In our second type of compound, the first word describes the second in some
way. Here are some English examples:

{ul
{li "wallpaper" (paper for a wall)}
{li "chessboard" (a board for chess)}
{li "beekeeper" (keeper of bees)}
}

In all of these compounds, the second word is the main idea, and the first word
modifies it. In Sanskrit, this kind of compound is called a {dfn {s
tatpuruSa}} compound.

Here are some Sanskrit examples of {s tatpuruSa} compounds:

{ex

rAmasya mAtA > rAmamAtA
Rama's mother

rAmasya putraH > rAmaputraH
Rama's son

tasya puruSaH > tatpuruSaH
his man

}

The word {s tatpuruSa} ("his man") comes from the words {s tat} ("he, that
one") and {s puruSa} ("man"). So, the word "{s tatpuruSa}" is itself a {s
tatpuruSa} compound:

{ex

tasya puruSaH > tatpuruSaH
his man

}


{h Understanding compounds}

Someone who doesn't know what the word "wallpaper" means might interpret it in
an unusual way:

{ul
    {li "paper that is also a wall," as in "I built this house with wallpaper."}
    {li "paper that is on a wall," as in "I hung my diploma next to my other wallpapers."}
    {li "a wall and some paper," as in "I bought a wall-paper but sold the paper."}
}

You probably know that these interpretations of "wallpaper" don't make sense.
This is because you know the cultural context: you know what wallpaper is.

Many Sanskrit compounds are the same way. If you know their cultural context
and are familiar with them, they are easy to understand.  If not, they can be
difficult.

Thankfully, there are some basic rules of thumb that we can use to tell
compounds apart. For example, if the words in a compound are all names, or all
foods, or all flowers -- that is, if they all have the same "type" -- then the
compound is probably a {s dvandva}.

There are other basic rules we can use for the other types of compounds. We'll
discuss these rules in a later lesson.
