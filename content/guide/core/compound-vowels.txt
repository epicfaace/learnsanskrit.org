{title Compound vowels}

In the previous lesson, we learned how vowels combine if the first vowel is not
{s a} or {s A}. In those situations, the first vowel becomes a semivowel:

{ex

i + a > ya

}


But what {em does} happen if the first vowel is {s a} or {s A}?

{ex

(a, A) + i > ?

}

In this lesson, we will learn what happens and complete our basic picture of
the Sanskrit vowels.


{h {s e} and {s o}}

{s a} and {s A} combine well with other vowels. So when {s a} or {s A} is the
first vowel, we get these new combinations:

{ex

(a, A) + (i, I) > e

(a, A) + (u, U) > o

(a, A) + (R, RR) > ar

(a, A) + L > al

}

{s r} and {s l} are semivowels, and we have seen them already. But {s e} and {s
o} are new sounds:

{sounds-dr e o}

{s e} and {s o} are called {dfn compound vowels}, since they are compounds of
two different vowel sounds. Compound vowels are always {em long} vowels. All of
the other vowels we've seen are called {dfn simple vowels}, and these simple
vowels can be either short (like {s a}) or long (like {s A}).


{h {s ai} and {s au}}

Can we combine {s a} with these new sounds again? Yes, we can:

{ex

(a, A) + e > ai

(a, A) + o > au

(a, A) + ar > Ar

(a, A) + al > Al

}

{s ai} and {s au} are also compound vowels, and they are also long:

{sounds-dr ai au}

Can we combine {s a} with these sounds once more? We can, but the result is the
same. There are no more sounds we can create:

{ex

(a, A) + ai > ai

(a, A) + au > au

(a, A) + Ar > Ar

(a, A) + Al > Al

}

{h Combining compound vowels}

We have seen almost all of the different ways that Sanskrit vowels combine with
each other. But there is one loose end. What if the first vowel is a compound
vowel?

If the first vowel is a compound vowel, then we usually see the following
changes:

{ex

e + a > ay a

ai + a > Ay a

o + a > av a

au + a > Av a

}

And likewise if the second vowel is not {s a}.

If these changes feel strange to you, it might help to remember where the
compound vowels come from. For example, the compound vowel {s e} comes from the
vowels {s a} and {s i}. So when {s e} is followed by some other vowel, it's as
if the {s i} sound becomes the semivowel {s y}:

{ex

e + a > [a + i] + a

[a + i] + a > ay a

}

We can think about {s ai} in the same way:

{ex

ai + a > [a + a + i] + a

[a + a + i] + a > Ay a

}

But if thinking about the vowels this way is too confusing, you can just
memorize the four changes above. We repeat them here for convenience:

{ex

e + a > ay a

ai + a > Ay a

o + a > av a

au + a > Av a

}


{h Review}

We have now seen all of the fundamental Sanskrit vowels. Here they are in their
traditional order:

{sounds-dr a-1 A-1 i-2 I-2 u-5 U-5}
{sounds-dr R-3 RR-3 L-4}
{sounds-dr e ai o au}

In the next lesson, we will learn about {em consonants}. But before that, here
are a few review questions: 

{ol
{li Which vowels are short? Which vowels are long?}
{li Which vowels are compound vowels?}
{li What do we get when we combine {s o} and {s i}?}
{li What do we get when we combine {s au} and {s e}?}
}
