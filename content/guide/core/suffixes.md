{title Suffixes}

In the previous lesson, we learned that prefixes are small groups of sounds
that we add to the {em beginning} of something. A group of sounds that we add
to the {em end} of something is called a {dfn suffix}.

Sanskrit has many different kinds of suffixes. Verb and nominal endings are all
suffixes. So are the suffixes that turn verb roots into verb stems:

{ex

nI + a > naya
lead > lead

nI + Sya > neSya 
lead > will lead

nI + i > nAyi
lead > make lead

}


{h Sound changes}

Sanskrit suffixes can cause many different sound changes. Most commonly, a
suffix will make the root's vowel change. Usually, the root's vowel will become
a compound vowel, and that vowel might change due to sandhi rules:

{ex

nI + a > ne + a > naya

}

In English, we usually call these kinds of changes {dfn vowel strengthening}.
The idea is that a compound vowel is "stronger" than the simple vowel it comes
from. You can see some examples of vowel strengthening in the examples below:

{ex

nI + a > naya

nI + Sya > ne + Sya > neSya 

nI + i > nai + i > nAyi

}

Since we know Sanskrit sounds well, we can see a connection between {s I}, {s
e}, {s ai}, {s ay}, and {s Ay}: {s I} is the root vowel, {s e} and {s ai} are
its compound vowels, and {s ay} and {s Ay} appear due to sandhi. This is why it
is so important to understand Sanskrit's sounds and sandhi rules.


{h Root suffixes}

{dfn Root suffixes} are suffixes that we add directly to a verb root. Usually,
they create nouns and adjectives. There are too many suffixes to list here, but
let's consider two examples.

First is the suffix {s -a}. (We add the "-" sign at the beginning to emphasize
that this is a suffix.) {s -a} has many functions, but it commonly creates
abstract nouns:

{ex

vid > veda
know > knowledge; one of the four Vedas

ji > jaya
conquer > conquest, victory

yuj > yoga
yoke, join, unite > yoking, junction, union; yoga

}

In the last example above, note that {s j} becomes {s g}. The sounds {s c} and
{s j} often become {s k} and {s g} when certain suffixes follow them.

Next is the suffix {s -ta}. {s -ta} does not strengthen the root's vowel. When
added to a root that means "to X," this suffix usually means "(has been) X-ed."

{ex

ji > jita
conquer > (has been) conquered

yuj > yukta
yoke, join, unite > (has been) yoked, joined, or united

kR + ta > kRta
do, make > (has been) done, (has been) made

}

Can we use prefixes and suffixes together? Yes. For example, let's use the
prefix {s sam-} that we used in the previous lesson. In addition to meaning
"with" or "together," this prefix can also mean "completely" or "fully":

{ex

saMji > saMjaya
completely conquer > complete victory; Sanjay (a name)

}

Let's try combining {s sam} with the root {s kR} above. By a specific grammar
rule, this combination becomes {s saMskR} with an extra {s s}. Does {s saMskR}
look familiar to you?

{ex

saMskR + ta > saMskRta
completely or fully make; refine, perfect > perfected, refined; Sanskrit

}


{h Nominal suffixes}

{dfn Nominal suffixes} are suffixes that we usually add to nominal stems. As
before, there are too many to list here. But as before, let's consider two
examples.

First is the suffix {s -in}. When we add {s -in} to a word that means "X," we
create a word that means "characterized by X":

{ex

yoga + in > yogin
yoga > characterized by yoga; a yogi

}

Next is the suffix {s -tva}. When we add {s -tva} to a word that means "X," we
creates a word that means "X-ness":

{ex

yoga + tva > yogatva
yoga > "yoga-ness"; the state of yoga

}


{h Review}

Sanskrit has many different root and nominal suffixes. We can use these
suffixes to quickly and simply create a variety of complex and expressive
words.
