{title Review}

Congratulations! You have completed the core lessons. Take a moment to
celebrate your hard work and review what you have learned.

We encourage you to set grammar aside for now and focus on finding interesting 
content. (See our {url[r=site.resources] resources page} for details.) But if
you want to continue, you can explore the other topics of this guide in
whatever order you like. Go wherever your interests take you.


{h Sounds and sandhi}

We started by learning about the Sanskrit sounds and their traditional order:

{sounds-dr a-1 A-1 i-2 I-2 u-5 U-5}
{sounds-dr R-3 RR-3 L-4}
{sounds-dr e ai o au}
{sounds-dr aM aH-1}
{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1}
{sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}
{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3}
{sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}
{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5}
{sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5}
{sounds-dr za-2 Sa-3 sa-4 ha-1}

We then learned how to split these sounds into syllables:

{ex

dharmakSetre kurukSetre > [dha rma kSe tre] ku [ru kSe tre]

}

Then, we studied some simple sandhi rules and learned how these sounds combine
with each other.


{h Words and sentences}

After studying sounds and sandhi, we moved to sentences and words. We learned
what Sanskrit sentences are like and how they behave. We also learned about the
three basic types of Sanskrit words: nominals, verbs, and uninflected
words.

We learned that nominals express information like gender:

{ex

gajaH pazyati.
The (male) elephant sees.

gajA pazyati.
The (female) elephant sees.

}

case:

{ex

gajaz carati.
The elephant walks.

rAmo gajaM carati.
Rama walks to the elephant.

}

and number:

{ex

gajaH pazyati.
The elephant sees.

gajau pazyataH.
The two elephants see.

gajAH pazyanti.
The (many) elephants see.

}

We also learned that verbs express information like person:

{ex

nayati
(Someone) leads.

nayasi
You lead.

nayAmi
I lead.

}

number:

{ex

nayati
(Someone) leads.

nayataH
The two of them lead.

nayanti
All of them lead.

}

tense-mood:

{ex

nayAmi
I lead.

neSyAmi
I will lead.

nayeyam
I might lead.

}

{s prayoga}:

{ex

nayasi
You lead.

nIyase
You are led.

}

and {s pada}, which we will discuss in a later lesson.


{h Prefixes, suffixes, and compounds}

Finally, we learned about how to create new words using prefixes:

{ex

gacchanti > Agacchanti
They go. > They come.

hiMsA > ahiMsA
violence > non-violence


}

suffixes:

{ex

yuj > yoga
yoke, join, unite > yoking, junction, union; yoga

yoga > yogin
yoga > yogi


}

and compounds:

{ex

rAmaH sItA ca > rAmasIte
Rama and Sita

rAmasya mAtA > rAmamAtA
Rama's mother

}


{h Questions}

Together, these core lessons are a complete high-level summary of Sanskrit grammar. What remain, of course, are the details.

{ol
    {li What are the five points of pronunciation?}
    {li Which vowels are compound vowels?}
    {li What is the basic principle that most sandhi changes follow?}
    {li Why can we reorder the words in a Sanskrit sentence?}
    {li What are the basic parts of a verb?}
    {li What are the basic parts of a noun?}
    {li Describe one of the Sanskrit compounds we learned about.}
