{title Prefixes}

So far, our core lessons have covered two major areas:

{ul
    {li First, we studied the Sanskrit sounds: how they are pronounced, what
    they are like, and how they interact with each other through sandhi.}
    {li Next, we studied the basics of Sanskrit sentences: what they're like,
    what kinds of words they use, and how these words behave.}
}

As we come to the end of our core lessons, we will study the third and final
major area of Sanskrit grammar: how to make new Sanskrit words.

We'll start by learning about prefixes. {dfn Prefixes} are small groups of
sounds that we add to the beginning of something else. Most prefixes are
uninflected words. By adding prefixes to a word, we can change its basic
meaning.


{h Verb prefixes}

Prefixes usually change a verb's basic meaning in one of three different ways:

{ul
    {li Often, the prefix changes the verbs's meaning in a straightforward way.
    For example, if you know what "use" means, then you can probably guess what
    "overuse" and "underuse" mean.}

    {li Sometimes, the prefix creates a more idiomatic change. For example, if
    we {em understand} something, we don't literally {em stand under}
    something.}

    {li And sometimes, the prefix intensifies the word's basic meaning or
    produces essentially no change. For example, "flammable" and "inflammable"
    mean essentially the same thing.}
}

Let's learn about two prefixes here. First is the prefix {s-dfn A-}. (We add
"-" to emphasize that this is a prefix.) {s A-} has the basic sense of "here"
or "toward." Notice how it affects the basic meaning of the verbs in the
examples below:

{ex

gacchanti > [A]gacchanti
they go > they come ("go [here]")

nayanti > [A]nayanti
they lead > they bring ("lead [here]")

}

Next is the prefix {s-dfn sam-}. {s sam-} has the basic sense of "with" or
"together." Again, notice how it affects the basic meaning of the verbs below:

{ex

gacchanti > [saM]gacchanti
they go > they meet ("go [together]")

nayanti > [saM]nayanti
they lead > They unite ("lead (others) [together]")

}

Prefixes can also be combined. Up above, we learned what {s Agacchanti} and {s
saMgacchanti} mean. So what do you think {s samAgacchanti} means?

{ex

gacchanti > [samA]gacchanti
they go > they come together; they convene ("go [together here]")

nayanti > [samA]nayanti
they lead > they gather ("lead [together here]")


}


{h Nominal prefixes}

Prefixes often change a verb's meaning, but they can also change a nominal's
basic meaning.

Again, let's learn about two prefixes here. First is the prefix {s-dfn a-}. {s
a-} has different meanings in different contexts. But when attached to a
nominal, {s a-} has the basic meaning of "not." Or if the nominal starts with a
vowel, we use {s an-} instead.

{ex

hiMsA > [a]hiMsA
violence > [non-]violence

bala > [a]bala
strength > [without] strength; powerless

}

{aside
This prefix is related to the prefixes in words like "in-credible" "a-moral,"
and "un-able."
}

Next is the prefix {s sa-}. Like {s sam-}, {s sa-} has the basic sense of
"with" or "together":

{ex

bala > [sa]bala
strength > [with] strength; strong, powerful

}


{h Review}

Prefixes are quite simple. There are a few small subtleties to them, but we can
discuss those in a later lesson.
