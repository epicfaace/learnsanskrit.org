{title Sandhi}

When we speak quickly, we make many kinds of small and subconscious changes to
the way we speak. These small changes let us speak more quickly and smoothly.
For example, some native English speakers will not pronounce the final "g"
sound of words like "walking" and "going."

These kinds of sound changes also occur in Sanskrit. Here is a simple example:

{ex

sItA azvam icchati > [sItAzvam] icchati
Sita wants a horse.

}

When we speak quickly, it is difficult to pause after the {s A} in {s sItA} and
start again with the first {s a} of {s azvam}. By combining these two vowels
into a single sound, our speech remains fast and smooth. 

In Sanskrit, these sound changes are called {dfn sandhi}, which means "joining"
or "junction." Sandhi refers to what happens at the {em junction} of different
sounds.

Every language has its own sandhi changes. But Sanskrit sandhi is unusual
because it is often written down. For example, the Sanskrit words {s gajo} and
{s gajas} have exactly the same meaning, but we use {s gajo} in front of some
sounds and {s gajas} in front of others:

{ex

[gajo] nagaraM gacchati.
The elephant goes to the village.

[gajas] taruM gacchati.
The elephant goes to the tree.

}

Why are sandhi changes written down in Sanskrit? Sanskrit speakers cared about
the power of spoken language. Writing, when it was used at all, was meant to
preserve the sound of spoken Sanskrit. So since sandhi changes appear in spoken
Sanskrit, they usually appear in written Sanskrit too.

In this lesson, we'll learn a few basic sandhi rules. Studying these rules will
also help us build up our awareness of different Sanskrit sounds.


{h The basic principle of sandhi}

This is the basic principle of sandhi:

{note Generally, sandhi makes it easier to speak quickly and smoothly.}

If you remember this basic principle, you can save yourself hours of time. In
fact, this principle is so important that we will say it twice:

{note Generally, sandhi makes it easier to speak quickly and smoothly.}

We urge you to read the examples below {em out loud}. Read them slowly, and
read them quickly. Notice which sounds are easy to say and which are difficult.
Over time, your mind and body will develop an intuition for how sandhi changes
should feel.


{h Vowel sandhi}

{dfn Vowel sandhi} is the name for sandhi rules between two vowels.

Actually, we have studied most of vowel sandhi already. When we studied the
different vowel combinations, what we were really studying were vowel sandhi
rules. As a reminder, here are some examples of vowel sandhi:

{ex

sItA azvam icchati > [sItAzvam] icchati
Sita wants a horse.

sItA iSum icchati > [sIteSum] icchati
Sita wants an arrow.

sItA etam icchati > [sItaitam] icchati
Sita wants this.

sItA udakam icchati > [sItodakam] icchati
Sita wants water.

sItA odanam icchati > [sItaudanam] icchati
Sita wants rice.

}

And a few more with a different first vowel:

{ex

zabarI azvam icchati > [zabary azvam] icchati
Shabari wants a horse.

zabarI iSum icchati > [zabarISum] icchati
Shabari wants an arrow.

zabarI odanam icchati > [zabary odanam] icchati
Shabari wants rice.

}


{h {s visarga} sandhi}

{dfn {s visarga} sandhi} is the name for sandhi changes where the first sound
is the {s visarga}. For now, we will give some basic examples of {s visarga}
sandhi. 

One common change is that the {s visarga} becomes {s za} if followed by the
letters {s ca} or {s cha}:


{ex

gajAH caranti > [gajAz] caranti.
The elephants walk.

}

and {s sa} if followed by the letters {s ta} or {s tha}:

{ex

gajAH tiSThanti > [gajAs] tiSThanti.
The elephants stand.

}

The idea is that the {s visarga}, which is pronounced at the soft palate,
changes to match the point of pronunciation used by {s ca}, {s cha}, {s ta},
and {s tha}. When these sounds match, we can pronounce them together more
easily.

Another change is that the {s visarga} disappears if a voiced sound follows it:

{ex

gajAH gacchanti. > [gajA] gacchanti.
The elephants go.

gajAH nadanti. > [gajA] nadanti.
The elephants roar.

gajAH Amram pazyanti. > [gajA] AmraM pazyanti.
The elephants see a mango tree.

}

Just as a drop of water vanishes when it touches a hot pan, the unvoiced {s
visarga} vanishes when it touches a voiced sound. But one important exception
is that {s aH} becomes {s o} if a voiced consonant follows:

{ex

rAmaH yudhyate > [rAmo] yudhyate
Rama fights.

rAmaH jayati > [rAmo] jayati
Rama conquers.

rAmaH hasati > [rAmo] hasati
Rama laughs.

}

There is a complex explanation for this change. But, it is faster and simpler
to just memorize it.


{h Consonant sandhi}

{dfn Consonant sandhi} is the name for sandhi rules where the first sound is a
consonant. Here we will give one small example of consonant sandhi. When the
sound {s m} is followed by a consonant, it becomes the {s anusvAra}:

{ex

rAmaH sAgaram gacchati > rAmaH [sAgaraM] gacchati.
Rama goes to the ocean.

rAmaH vanam gacchati > rAmo [vanaM] gacchati.
Rama goes to the forest.

rAmaH candram gacchati > rAmaz [candraM] gacchati.
Rama goes to the moon.

}

Remember: the {s anusvAra} is often used as a shorthand way to write down
different nasal sounds. For example, the two sentences below are written
differently, but they are often pronounced identically:

{ex

rAmaH sAgaraM gacchati

rAmaH sAgaraG gacchati.

}

If we keep this in mind, then we have the same principle as before: {s m}
changes to match the point of pronunciation used by the following sound. When
both sounds use the same point of pronunciation, we can pronounce them together
more easily.


{h The {s avagraha}}

Finally, you may sometimes see this symbol when you read Sanskrit:

{sounds-dr '}

This symbol is called the {s-dfn avagraha}, and it is not pronounced.

The {s avagraha} is similar to the {dfn apostrophe} (') symbol that we use in
English. In English, one of the ways we use the apostrophe is to show that a
sound was removed. For example, the contraction "isn't" comes from "is not."
Here, the apostrophe in "isn't" shows that the "o" in "not" was removed.

In the same way, we use the {s avagraha} in Sanskrit to show that a vowel
(usually {s a}) was removed due to sandhi. Here is a common change that uses
the {s avagraha}:

{ex

rAmaH ayodhyAm gacchati > rAmo [']yodhyAM gacchati.
Rama goes to Ayodhya.

}

The rule here is that if the {s visarga} has an {s a} on either side of it, all
three sounds are replaced with {s o}. Again, there is a complicated explanation
for this change, but it is easier to just memorize it.

Different authors have their own preferences on whether to use the {s avagraha}
or not. So although it is useful, do not assume it will always be used.


{h Review}

Most sandhi changes follow simple principles that are easy to understand. When
in doubt, speak out loud. And if you want to learn much more about sandhi, see
