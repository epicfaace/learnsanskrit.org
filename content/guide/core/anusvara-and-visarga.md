{title {s anusvAra} and {s visarga}}

In this lesson, we will learn about the last two sounds in the Sanskrit
alphabet. These sounds often change when other sounds follow them. But with
what we have learned so far, we can easily understand these sounds and their
changes.


{h {s anusvAra}}

The first sound we will study is called the {dfn {s anusvAra}} ("after-sound"):

{sounds-dr aM}

(We've added {s a} before the {s anusvAra} to make it easier to pronounce.)

The {s anusvAra} has its own distinct pronunciation. But often, its written
form is used as a kind of "shorthand" for nasal sounds followed by a consonant.
In each example below, we should pronounce the word on the left in the same way
as the word on the right:

{ex

saMgaH > saGgaH

saMjayaH > saJjayaH

saMnyAsaH > sannyAsaH

saMbandhaH > sambandhaH

}

{h {s visarga}}

The next sound is called the {dfn {s visarga}} ("release"):

{sounds-dr aH-1}

(As with the {s anusvAra}, we've added {s a} before the {s visarga} to make it
easier to pronounce.)

Generally, the {s visarga} is pronounced like the "h" in "house." It is
pronounced at the soft palate.

In modern times, however, the {s visarga} is often pronounced like an "echo" of
the previous vowel when it is at the end of a phrase. So {s aH} is pronounced
like {s aha}, {s UH} is pronounced like {s Uhu}, {s aiH} is pronounced like {s
aihi}, and so on.


{h The Sanskrit alphabet}

Here is the standard Sanskrit alphabet in order. First are the simple vowels:

{sounds-dr a-1 A-1 i-2 I-2 u-5 U-5}
{sounds-dr R-3 RR-3 L-4}

Then the compound vowels:

{sounds-dr e ai o au}

Then the {s anusvAra} and {s visarga}:

{sounds-dr aM aH-1}

Then the consonants:

{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1}
{sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}
{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3}
{sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}
{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5}
{sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5}
{sounds-dr za-2 Sa-3 sa-4 ha-1}

In the list above, we have colored each letter according to the point of
pronunciation it uses. Letters that use two points of pronunciation are left
black. The {s anusvAra} is also left black, since it doesn't use any of these
points of pronunciation.

{note Technically, {s va} uses two points of pronunciation, since it uses the
upper teeth and the lower lip. But for conceptual clarity, we have colored it
like {s pa} and the others.}


{h Review}

Now we have seen all of the sounds used in normal Sanskrit. Our kitchen of
sounds is well-stocked and ready for use.

{ol
{li What is the sound {s aH} called? What is the sound {s aM} called?}
{li In modern times, how is {s auH} often pronounced at the end of a sentence?}
{li How is {s saMcaya} usually pronounced? How about {s saMbodhi}?}
}
