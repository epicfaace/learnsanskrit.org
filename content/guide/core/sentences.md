{title Sentences}

So far, we have focused on the smallest parts of Sanskrit: its sounds. But
rather than count every grain of rice, let's simply savor the meal in front of
us. In this lesson, let's consider Sanskrit from a broader point of view and
discuss some simple sentences. 


{h Word order}

Here is a simple Sanskrit sentence:

{ex

rAmaH sItAM pazyati.
Rama sees Sita.

}

Rama and Sita are two of the main characters in the {cite Ramayana}, one of
the ancient Sanskrit poems. For much of the {cite Ramayana}, Rama and Sita are
far apart, and Rama searches desperately to find her. So it is a happy thing
that Rama can see Sita at last.

Notice the {dfn word order} in this sentence. The main action of the sentence
is that one person is seeing another. The person who performs the action ({s
rAmaH}) is called the {dfn subject}. The person who is affected by the action
({s sItAm}) is called the {dfn object}. And the word that describes the action
({s pazyati}) is called the {dfn verb}.

In English, the usual order of these three is subject, then verb, then object.
So English is sometimes called a "subject-verb-object" (SVO) language. But
Sanskrit does not work this way. Like many Indian languages, it tends to use a
"subject-object-verb" (SOV) order.


{h Word endings}

Rama sees Sita, but perhaps Sita wants to see Rama too. So let's add another
sentence:

{ex

rAmaH sItAM pazyati.
Rama sees Sita.

sItA rAmaM pazyati.
Sita sees Rama.

}

Here we notice something else. When Rama is the person seeing, we use the word
{s rAmaH}. But when Rama is the person being seen, we use the word {s rAmam}.
({s rAmam} becomes {s rAmaM} due to sandhi.)

Every language expresses meaning in its own way. In Sanskrit, one of the
important ways we express different meanings is by changing a word. And
usually, we change a word by changing its ending.

Different word endings can show whether someone is the subject of a sentence
({s rAmaH}), the object of a sentence ({s rAmam}), or even something else
entirely:

{ex

sItA [rAmAya] pazyati.
Sita sees [for Rama].

sItA [rAmasya] pitaraM pazyati.
Sita sees [Rama's] father.

}

English uses different word endings in a limited way. We see one {em bird} but
two {em birds}; I {em run} in a field but someone {em runs} in a park. But
Sanskrit words use many different kinds of word endings. Some endings are very
simple, like the ones above. But other endings are more complex:

{ex

sItA rAmaM [pazyati].
Sita [sees] Rama.

sItA rAmaM [pazyet].
Sita [might see] Rama.

sItA rAmaM [pazyatu].
[May] Sita [see] Rama.

}


{h Changing the word order}

English uses word endings in a limited way, but the meaning of English
sentences is still clear. Why? It is because English uses {em word order} to
make meaning clear. For example, "Sita sees Rama" and "Rama sees Sita" mean
very different things. In English, word order is very important!

But Sanskrit already makes meaning clear through word endings. Does this mean
we can change the word order in Sanskrit? Yes, we can. All of the examples
below have the same meaning but use different word orders:

{ex

rAmaH sItAM pazyati.
Rama sees Sita.

sItAM rAmaH pazyati.
Rama sees Sita.

sItAM pazyati rAmaH.
Rama sees Sita.

rAmaH pazyati sItAm.
Rama sees Sita.

pazyati sItAM rAmaH.
Rama sees Sita.

pazyati rAmaH sItAm.
Rama sees Sita.

}

Sanskrit sentences generally follow the subject-object-verb order we described
above. But word order can change dramatically depending on the context. Certain
word orderings simply sound nicer than others, and some ideas are easier to
understand depending on the order they appear in.


{h Review}

Our {topic Sentences} topic will teach you much more about Sanskrit sentences
and how they work. But for now, let's change focus and learn more about the
different kinds of Sanskrit words. In the next three lessons, we will learn
about the three main word types that Sanskrit uses.

{ol
    {li What order does Sanskrit tend to use for its subjects, verbs, and
    objects?}
    {li Why can we rearrange the words in a Sanskrit sentence?}
