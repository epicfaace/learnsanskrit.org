{title Basic vowels}

Sanskrit students traditionally begin their studies by learning about the
different Sanskrit sounds. We will start our core lessons in the same way.

Why is it so important to study Sanskrit's sounds? It is because Sanskrit
sounds often transform due to {em sound change rules}. If we study Sanskrit's
sounds closely, then we can better use and understand these sound change rules.

For that reason, half of our core lessons are about sounds: how to pronounce
them, what they are like, and how they affect each other.

{h First, a note on scripts}

A {dfn script} is a way of writing down a language's sounds. In modern times,
most people write Sanskrit in the {dfn Devanagari} ({d devanAgarI}) script. In
the West, many people also use {dfn romanized} Sanskrit, which uses an extended
version of the Latin alphabet.

Most of the Sanskrit in our guide is written in both Devanagari and in
romanized Sanskrit. {web-only You can also change which scripts this lesson
uses by using the dropdown menu at the very top of the page. (You might have to
scroll up to see the menu.)} {print-only You can use a different script by
accessing our online guide at {code learnsanskrit.org/guide}.}

If you don't know Devanagari and want to learn it, see the {url[r=guide.topic
slug=devanagari] Devanagari topic} in our guide. But before you do, we
recommend that you finish the core lessons.

{h How do we make different sounds?}

When we speak, a stream of air flows out of our lungs and through our mouth and
nose. If we move our tongue, our lips, and other parts of our mouth, we can
modify this flow of air and create different sounds.

Simple and open sounds like "a" and "o" are called {dfn vowels}. When we
pronounce them, our breath flows straight out of our mouths. And by moving our
tongue and lips, we can create different vowel sounds: "Aaa! Eee! Ooo!"

The first Sanskrit vowel is {s a}. {s a} is a simple and relaxed sound:

{sounds-dr a-1}

{note
We're still adding audio to the new version of our guide. For now, you can
listen to all of these sounds through {a[href=https://ubcsanskrit.ca/lesson1/devan%C4%81gar%C4%AB.html] this resource} from the University of British Columbia.
}


{h Points of pronunciation}

If we change the position of our tongue and lips, we can modify the basic vowel
{s a} and create other vowels.

How might we modify this sound? One way is by changing the {dfn point of
pronunciation} we use. Sanskrit sounds use five basic points of pronunciation,
and you can see all five of them marked in the image below:

{comm TODO flip direction of image, make larger}

{img[src=points_of_pronunciation.png]}

From right to left, these points are:

{ul
{li the {dfn soft palate}, which is the soft and fleshy area at the back of your mouth}
{li the {dfn hard palate}, which is the hard and bony area that is sometimes called the "roof" of our mouth}
{li the edge of the roof of the mouth, near the "hard bump" near our teeth}
{li the base of our teeth}
{li the lips}
}


When we pronounce {s a}, our tongue rests near our soft palate:

{sounds-dr a-1}

But if we change where our tongue rests in our mouth, we can create different
vowel sounds. For example, we can move the middle of our tongue closer to the
hard palate:

{sounds-dr i-2}

Or the tip of our tongue might rest near the bump on the roof of our mouth:

{sounds-dr R-3}

Or the tip might rest near the base of the teeth:

{sounds-dr L-4}

Or we might use our lips instead:

{sounds-dr u-5}

By using these five points of pronunciation, we create five different vowel
sounds. And by changing our pronunciation in other ways, we can create many
other kinds of sounds.

{note
In Sanskrit's early history, people pronounced the sounds {s R} and {s L} in a
simple way. Today, people in different regions pronounce them in different
styles. So, you might hear many different pronunciations for these vowels.

{h Review}

In the next lesson, we'll combine the basic vowels above and create a variety
of different sounds.
