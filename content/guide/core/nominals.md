{title Nominals}

In the previous lesson, we learned about basic Sanskrit sentences. Sanskrit
sentences use three main word types: verbs like {s pazyati}, "naming" words
like {s rAmaH}, and a third type that we'll study in a later lesson.

"Naming" words like {s rAmaH} are called {dfn nouns}. But Sanskrit has many
other kinds of words that behave similarly to nouns. These include {dfn
adjectives}, which describe a noun:

{ex

    [kRSNo] gauH khAdati.
    The [black] cow eats.

    [zvetA] svapiti.
    The [white] one sleeps.

    [sukhino] gajAH pibanti.
    The [happy] elephants drink.


}

{dfn pronouns}, which replace a noun:

{ex

    [sa] khAdati.
    [He] eats.

    [sA] svapiti.
    [She] sleeps.

    [te] pibanti.
    [They] drink.

}

and {dfn numerals}, which tell us how many of something we have:

{ex

    [eko] gauH khAdati
    [One] cow eats.

    [ekA] svapiti.
    [One] sleeps.

    [trayo] gajAH pibanti.
    [Three] elephants eat.

}

For convenience, let's call all of these words {dfn nominals}. "Nominal" is
a word that means "name-like." So a nominal is a word that is {em like} a noun.


{h Stems and endings}

Let's start our discussion with some simple nominal words:

{ex

rAmaH
Rama (as the subject of the sentence)

rAmam
Rama (as the object of the sentence)

}

Each of these words has two parts. First, there is a simple core that expresses
the main idea of "Rama":

{ex

rAma
Rama

}

Second, we have an ending that modifies this basic idea in some way:

{ex

rAma + [H] > rAmaH
Rama (as the subject of the sentence)

rAma + [m] > rAmam
Rama (as the object)

}

{s rAma} is called a {dfn stem}, and {s H} and {s m} are called {dfn endings}.
Just as many flowers might grow from a single plant stem, many words might grow
from the same word stem.

As you can see in the examples above, a nominal ending can show whether a word
is the {em subject} of the sentence or the {em object} of the sentence. These
endings can show other kinds of information too:

{ex

sa [rAmAya] phalaM dadAti.
He gives a fruit [to Rama].

}

Specifically, a nominal ending shows {em three} basic kinds of information in
Sanskrit. Let's learn more about what these three kinds of information are.


{h Gender}

The first kind of information we get from a nominal ending is its {dfn gender}.
In the examples below, notice how the nominal ending changes. This change shows
a change in the noun's gender:

{ex

[gajaH] pazyati.
The [(male)] elephant sees.

[gajA] pazyati.
The [(female)] elephant sees.

}

Word gender is similar to our real-world concept of male and female genders.
Usually, male-gendered beings use a {dfn masculine} gender and female-gendered
beings use a {dfn feminine} gender. Sanskrit also has a {dfn neuter} gender
that is neither male nor female:

{ex

etat [phalam].
This is a fruit.

}

Each Sanskrit noun has its own gender. If a noun refers to a person or animal,
we can usually guess the noun's gender. But when a noun does {em not} refer to
a person or animal, it can be hard to guess what the gender should be. For
example, consider the nouns below. None of these genders is obvious:

{ex

vRkSa
tree (masculine)

phala
fruit (neuter)

agni
fire (masculine)

kIrti
glory (feminine)

nadI
river (feminine)

senAnI
army leader (masculine)

}

Fortunately, we can usually guess a noun's gender by examining how its stem
ends. We'll explain this more in a later lesson.


{h Number}

The second kind of information we get from a nominal ending is its
{dfn number}. Simply, "number" is the number of items the nominal
refers to. It might refer to one item, which is called the {dfn singular}:

{ex

[gajaH] pazyati.
The [(one)] elephant sees.

}

To two items, which is called the {dfn dual}:

{ex

[gajau] pazyataH.
The [two] elephants see.

}

Or to more than two items, which is called the {dfn plural}:

{ex

[gajAH] pazyanti.
The [(many)] elephants see.

}

Notice that the verb {s pazyati} changes when the number of
the noun changes. Verbs like {s pazyati} have number as well. Usually,
the verb's number and the subject's number should match.


{h Case}

The third kind of information we get from a nominal ending is its {dfn case}.
"Case" is a technical word that is hard to define. Roughly, a word's {em case}
is the role that the word plays in the sentence.

Sanskrit uses eight different cases. {dfn Case 1} is usually the subject of the
action:

{ex

[siMhaH] pazyati.
[The lion] sees.

}

{dfn Case 2} is usually the object:

{ex

siMho [grAmaM] pazyati.
The lion sees [a village].

}

{dfn Case 3} usually means "by means of":

{ex

siMho [mArgeNa] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [by means of the road].

}

{dfn Case 4} usually means "for":

{ex

siMho [mAMsAya] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [for meat].

}

{dfn Case 5} usually means "from":

{ex

siMho [vanAd] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes [from the forest] to the village.

}

{dfn Case 6} usually means "of":

{ex

siMho [grAmasya] narAn khAdati.
The lion eats the men [of the village] (or, [the village's] men).

}

{dfn Case 7} usually means "on" or "in":

{ex

siMho [grAme] carati.
The lion walks [in the village].

}

And {dfn case 8} is the person being spoken to:

{ex

he [siMha] vanaM gaccha.
Hey [lion]! Go to the forest.

}


{h Using adjectives}

In Sanskrit, we can use adjectives without a noun:

{ex

[kRSNo] gacchati.
[The black one] goes.

[sundarAH] khAdanti.
[The handsome ones] eat.

}

If we do use a noun, the  adjective must use the same gender, case, and number
as the noun it describes:

{ex
    [kRSNaH] khagaH
    black bird

    [kRSNau] khagau
    two black birds

    [kRSNAH] khagAH
    (many) black birds

    rAmaH [kRSNaM] khagaM pazyati.
    Rama sees a black bird.
}

More technically, we can say that an adjective must {dfn agree} with the noun
it describes.


{h Review}

Nominal words are one of the three main types of Sanskrit words. In the next
lesson, we'll learn about the second main type: verbs like {s pazyati} and
{s carati}.
