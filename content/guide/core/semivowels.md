{title Semivowels}

Just as we can combine sugar and salt to make new flavors, we can combine
vowels that use {em different} points of pronunciation to make new sounds.

If the first vowel is not {s a} or {s A}, then it becomes a special shortened
form. For example, {s i} or {s I} might change like this:

{ex

(i, I) + a > ya

(i, I) + A > yA

}

And likewise for {s yu}, {s yU}, {s yR}, {s yRR}, and {s yL}. We can make
similar combinations with the other vowels:

{ex

(i, I) + a > ya

(R, RR) + a > ra

L + a > la

(u, U) + a > va

}

And likewise if the second vowel is not {s a}.

Together, these combinations give us four new sounds:

{sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5}

Why do we add {s a} to all of these sounds? We add {s a} so that we can
pronounce these sounds more easily. At the same time, adding {s a} lets us
create convenient names for these sounds. For example, we can talk about the
sound {s ya}, the sound {s ra}, and so on.

These new sounds are similar to vowels, but they behave a little differently
from the vowels we've seen. So, they are called {dfn semivowels}. Each
semivowel uses a different point of pronunciation:

{ul
    {li {s ya} is pronounced at the same point as {s i} and {s I}.}
    {li {s ra} is pronounced at the same point as {s R} and {s RR}.}
    {li {s la} is pronounced at the same point as {s L}.}
    {li {s va} is pronounced at the same point as {s u} and {s U}.}
}

{note
Semivowels are a part of a larger group of sounds called {dfn consonants}. We
will learn more about consonants in a future lesson.

In the next lesson, we will complete our study of the Sanskrit vowels. For
review, see if you can combine the sounds below correctly:

{ex

I + u > ?

RR + I > ?

L + e > ?

u + A > ?

}
