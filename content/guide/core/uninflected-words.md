{title Uninflected words}

Sanskrit sentences use three basic types of words: verbs like {s pazyati},
nominals like {s rAmaH}, and a third category that we can call {dfn uninflected
words}. For example, the common word {s na} ("not") is an uninflected word:

{ex

gajo [na] gacchati.
The elephant does [not] go.

}

What does {em uninflected} mean? In Sanskrit, we can change a word to express
different meanings:

{ex

nI > nayanti
lead > they lead

}

The technical name for these kinds of word changes is {dfn inflection}.  Many
Sanskrit words are inflected, and many Sanskrit words are {em uninflected}.
Uninflected words can still be changed by sandhi, but otherwise, they always
stay the same.

For example, consider the examples below. In each sentence, the nominal and
verb change. But the uninflected word {s na} stays the same:

{ex

gajo [na] gacchati.
The elephant does [not] go.

gajau [na] gamiSyataH.
The two elephants will [not] go.

gajA [na] gaccheyuH.
The elephants might [not] go.

}

Uninflected words are simple. So in this lesson, we will simply learn about a few different kinds of uninflected words.


{h {s ca} and {s vA}}

{s-dfn ca} is a common uninflected word that means "and." Notice how {s ca} is
used in the examples below:

{ex

rAmaH sItA [ca] gacchataH.
Rama [and] Sita go.

rAmaH sItA gajaz [ca] gacchanti.
Rama, Sita, [and] the elephant go.

}

In English, we use the word "and" just before the last item in our list: Rama,
Sita, {em and} the elephant. But in Sanskrit, {s ca} comes at the end of the
list of items: {s rAmaH sItA gajaz {strong ca}}.

We can use {s-dfn vA}, which means "or," in the same way:

{ex

rAmaH sItA [vA] gacchati.
Rama [or] Sita goes.

rAmaH sItA gajo [vA] gacchati.
Rama, Sita, [or] the elephant goes.

}

We can also repeat {s ca} to say "Both ... and ..." and {s vA} to say "Either
... or ..." Here are some examples:

{ex

rAmaz [ca] sItA [ca] gacchataH.
[Both] Rama [and] Sita go.

rAmo [vA] sItA [vA] gacchati.
[Either] Rama [or] Sita goes.

}

In an earlier lesson, we learned that Sanskrit word order is very flexible. But
it is not {em completely} flexible. Specifically, {s ca} and {s vA} cannot
appear at the start of a sentence. This means that the example sentence below
is not correct Sanskrit:

{ex

* [ca] rAmaH sItA gacchataH.

}


{h {s saha} and {s vinA}}

We can also use uninflected words to modify the basic sense of another word.
For example, there is a nominal case that usually means "by means of":

{ex

rAmo [gajena] nagaraM gacchati.
Rama goes to the city [by means of an elephant].

}

Do you remember what we call this case? We call it {em case 3}. If we use the
uninflected words {s saha} or {s vinA} with a case 3 word, we can refine the
basic sense that case 3 expresses:

{ex

rAmo gajena [saha] nagaraM gacchati.
Rama goes to the city [with an elephant].

rAmo gajena [vinA] nagaraM gacchati.
Rama goes to the city [without an elephant].

}

{s saha} and {s vinA} usually follow the word they modify.


{h {s -tvA}}

As a final example, we can add the suffix {s-dfn -tvA} to a verb root. If the
root means "X," the result means "having done X" or "after doing X." Here are
some examples:

{ex

nI + tvA > [nItvA]
lead > [having led]

kR + tvA > [kRtvA]
do, make > [having done or made]

}

These new words are used like verbs. In the examples below, the first two
sentences are simple, and the third one uses the {s -tvA} ending to create a
more complex sentence:

{ex

rAmo nagaraM gacchati.
Rama goes to the city.

rAmaH sItAM pazyati.
Rama sees Sita.

rAmo nagaraM [gatvA] sItAM pazyati.
Rama, [after going] to the city, sees Sita.

}


{h Review}

There are many different kinds of uninflected words, but they are all used in a
simple way. Once we create them, we don't have to make any changes for gender,
case, number, person, tense-mood, {s prayoga}, or anything else.
