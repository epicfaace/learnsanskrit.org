{title The Sanskrit language}

Our {dfn core lessons} will teach you about all of Sanskrit at a basic level.
Together, these core lessons will help you build a strong tree trunk for the
rest of your studies. 

First, our lessons will focus on the Sanskrit sounds: what they are, how they
are pronounced, and how they affect each other. We will then learn some of the
{em sound change rules} that Sanskrit often uses. Here is a simple example of a
sound change rule:

{ex

kRSNaH na yudhyate > [kRSNo] na yudhyate
Krishna does not fight.

}

(Don't worry about the details here; we will explain them later.)

Once we finish learning about Sanskrit's sounds and sound change rules, we will
learn about basic Sanskrit sentences. We will also learn about the three {em
basic word types} that Sanskrit uses. First, we will learn about naming words
like "Krishna":

{ex

[kRSNo] na yudhyate.
[Krishna] does not fight.

}

Next, we will learn about action words like "fight":

{ex

kRSNo na [yudhyate].
Krishna does not [fight].

}

Finally, we will learn about miscellaneous words like "not":

{ex

kRSNo [na] yudhyate.
Krishna does [not] fight.

}

We will end our core lessons by learning how to {em create} new words in
Sanskrit. Here are some examples of the kinds of words we can create:

{ex

yuj + a > [yoga]
yoke, join, unite > yoking, junction, union; [yoga]

yoga + in > [yogin]
yoga > characterized by yoga; [yogi]

karman + yoga > [karmayoga]
`karma (action) + yoga > yoga of action; [karma yoga]

}

Together, these core lessons will give us a complete view of Sanskrit grammar.
Once you finish these core lessons and know them well, you can explore the rest
of our guide in whatever order you like.
