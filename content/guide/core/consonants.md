{title Consonants}

In the previous lessons, we learned about the Sanskrit vowels and how they
combine with each other. In this lesson, we will learn about a new type of
sound: the {dfn consonant}. For example, the semivowels we saw in the previous
lesson ({s ya, ra, la, va}) are all consonants.

We create consonants by disturbing the clean flow of air through the mouth. If
we use the different points of pronunciation and touch them in different ways,
we can create many new consonant sounds.


{h The first 25 consonants}

When we make sounds like "k" and "p," the flow of air through our mouths stops
completely. We pronounce the first 25 Sanskrit consonants by {em stopping} the
flow of air through the mouth.

For example, we can create the sound {s k} by touching the base of the tongue
to the soft palate. We call this sound {s ka}, because {s ka} is easier to
pronounce than just {s k}:

{sounds-dr ka-1}

{s ka} is pronounced when the flow of air continues in a gentle way. If it
continues in a forceful way with extra air, we create a new sound {s kha}:

{sounds-dr kha-1}

{s kha} is called an {dfn aspirated} sound, and {s ka} is called an {dfn
unaspirated} sound. (The word "aspirated" just means "with extra breath," and
it is related to words like "respire" and "inspire."). When we change how we
use our breath, we change the basic sound {s ka} to create something new.

But we can make other changes besides just changing our breathing. If you touch
your fingers to your throat and pronounce the sounds "sss" and "zzz," you can
feel your throat and vocal cords vibrate. This vibration is called {dfn
voicing}.

Sounds like "s" don't use voicing, so they are called {dfn unvoiced}
sounds. Meanwhile, sounds like "z" {em do} use voicing, so they are likewise
called {dfn voiced} sounds. All of the vowels we have seen are also voiced
sounds. And just as we have the {em unvoiced} consonants {s ka} and {s kha}, we
have the {em voiced} consonants {s ga} and {s gha}:

{sounds-dr ga-1 gha-1}

We can also make sounds by {em redirecting} the flow of air. If we redirect
this flow of air through our nose, we create the sound {s Ga}. Since we
pronounce {s Ga} with the help of the nose, it is called a {dfn nasal}
consonant:

{sounds-dr Ga-1}

So from just the soft palate, we get five new consonant sounds:

{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1}

Now, what happens if we use the hard palate instead of the soft palate? We get
five more consonants:

{sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}

What if the tip of the tongue touches the hard bump on the roof of the mouth?
Then we get five more consonants:

{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3}

And likewise when the tip of the tongue touches the base of the teeth:

{sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}

Or when the lips touch:

{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5}

By using the five points of pronunciation, we have created 25 different
consonant sounds. Let's consider all 25 of these sounds together:

{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1}
{sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}
{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3}
{sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}
{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5}

These sounds form a grid with five rows and five columns. The sounds in each
row use the same point of pronunciation. And the sounds in each column have
similar properties:

{ul
    {li All the sounds in the first two columns (the {s ka} and {s kha}
    columns) are unvoiced, and the others are voiced.}
    {li All of the sounds in the second and fourth columns (the {s kha} and {s
    gha} columns) are aspirated, and the others are unaspirated.}
    {li All of the sounds in the fifth column ({s Ga Ja Na na ma}) are
    nasal consonants.}
}

This simple scheme, which is almost 3000 years old, lets us quickly understand
how the different consonant sounds relate to each other.


{h The other consonants}

We have just a few more consonants to examine.

Instead of stopping the flow of air, we can just {em constrict} it. If we do
so, we get the semivowels, which we saw in a previous lesson:

{sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5}

{s ra} has a rougher sound similar to what you might hear in Hindi or Spanish.
And {s va} is pronounced like a mix of the English "v" and "w" sounds.

We can also disturb the flow of air to make a {em hissing} sound. If we do so,
we can make three new sounds: {s za} at the hard palate, {s Sa} at the roof,
and {s sa} at the teeth. All three of these sounds are unvoiced:

{sounds-dr za-2 Sa-3 sa-4}

And finally, we can make a {em voiced} hissing sound by using the soft palate:

{sounds-dr ha-1}

We have now seen all of the standard Sanskrit consonants. Here they are in
their traditional order:

{sounds-dr ka-1 kha-1 ga-1 gha-1 Ga-1} {sounds-dr ca-2 cha-2 ja-2 jha-2 Ja-2}
{sounds-dr Ta-3 Tha-3 Da-3 Dha-3 Na-3} {sounds-dr ta-4 tha-4 da-4 dha-4 na-4}
{sounds-dr pa-5 pha-5 ba-5 bha-5 ma-5} {sounds-dr ya-2 ra-3 la-4 va-5} {sounds-dr
za-2 Sa-3 sa-4 ha-1}

{note
In Devanagari, consecutive consonants are written in an unusual way. For
details, see our {lesson[r=devanagari/consonant-clusters] lesson on consonant
clusters}.

{h Review}

We have seen almost all of the sounds used in normal Sanskrit. In the next
lesson, we'll study two more sounds and complete our study of the Sanskrit
alphabet.

{ol
{li What point of pronunciation does {s ja} use? What about {s da}?}
{li Which consonants are nasal sounds?}
{li Is {s ya} a vowel or a consonant?}
{li Is {s za} voiced or unvoiced? What about {s ha}?}
}
