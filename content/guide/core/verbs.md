{title Verbs}

In the previous lesson, we learned that there are three main types of Sanskrit
words: verbs like {s pazyati}, nominal words like {s rAmaH}, and a third type
that we'll study in the next lesson.

{dfn Verbs} are the core of a Sanskrit sentence. In fact, we can make a
complete sentence with just a single verb:

{ex

pazyanti.
They see.

}


{h Roots, stems and endings}

Let's start our discussion with some simple verbs:

{ex

nayanti
They lead.

nayasi
You lead.

nayAmi
I lead.

}

Like nominals, verbs have two parts: a {dfn stem} that carries the basic
meaning of the verb and an {dfn ending} that modifies this basic meaning. In
the examples above, {s naya} is the stem, and it has the basic sense of
"leading." By combining {s naya} with endings like {s -ti}, {s -nti}, and {s
-Ami}, we create different kinds of verbs.

But we can go deeper than this. Consider the verbs below:

{ex

naya + nti > nayanti
They lead.

neSya + nti > neSyanti
They will lead.

nAyaya + nti > nAyayanti
They make (someone) lead.

}

If we remove the {s -nti} ending, we see three different stems: {s naya}, {s
neSya}, and {s nAyaya}. All of them have slightly different meanings. But all
of them have to do with "leading" something, and all of them start with similar
sounds.

Thousands of years ago, the people who studied Sanskrit grammar thought about
words like {s nayanti}, {s neSyanti}, and {s nAyayati} and considered them
deeply.  They decided that all of these words share a common element, {s nI},
from which all of these stems arise.

{s nI} is called a {dfn verb root}. Just as flower stems grow from a shared
root, verb stems grow from a verb root. The verb root is short, compact, and
contains the basic meaning of the stems and verbs that grow from it:

{ex

[nI] > naya > nayanti
[lead] > lead > They lead.

[nI] > neSya > neSyanti
[lead] > will lead > They will lead.

[nI] > nAyi > nAyayanti
[lead] > make lead > They make (someone) lead.

}

Not all verbs have a clear and obvious root. But most verbs do.


{h Creating new verb roots}

Traditional grammar defines a list of around 2000 verb roots. But Sanskrit also
provides a few ways to create new verb roots from existing ones. These {dfn
derived roots} modify the root's basic meaning in some way.

For example, if we add {s i} to a verb root that means "X," we create a new
verb root that "make (someone) do X." You can see some examples of this below.

{ex

nI > nAyi > nAyayanti
lead > make lead > They make (someone) lead.

car > cAri > cArayanti
walk > make walk > They make (someone) walk.

}

Note that {s i} causes the sounds in the root to change. These kinds of changes
are common when we add sounds to verb roots.

We can even create roots by using different nominal words:

{ex

mUtra > mUtrayati
urine, pee > He pees.

}

We will learn more about all of these derived roots in a later lesson. But for
now, let's focus on verb {em endings} and the information they contain.

{h Person}

Generally, verb endings express five kinds of basic information. The first is
the verb's {dfn person}. "I go" and "He goes" express the same idea, but each
has a different perspective. This perspective is the {em person} of the verb.

Like English, Sanskrit has three persons. In the traditional Sanskrit order, we
have the {dfn third person}:

{ex

nayati
(Someone) leads.

}

the {dfn second person}:

{ex

nayasi
You lead.

}

and the {dfn first person}:

{ex

nayAmi
I lead.

}


{h Number}

The second kind of information is the verb's {dfn number}, which is the same
idea as a nominal's number. As before, we have the {dfn singular}:

{ex

nayati
(Someone) leads.

}

the {dfn dual}:

{ex

nayataH
The two of them lead.

}

and the {dfn plural}:

{ex

nayanti
They all lead.

}


{h Tense-mood}

The third kind of information is the verb's {dfn tense-mood}. A verb's {dfn
tense} is just the time period a verb refers to:

{ex

nayati
someone leads

neSyati
someone will lead

netA
someone will (eventually) lead

anayat
someone led

anaiSIt
someone (recently) led

ninAya
someone led (long ago)

}

And a verb's {dfn mood} is the way the verb expresses that information:

{ex

nayet
someone might lead

nayatu
(we command that) someone may lead

nIyAt
(we hope that) someone may lead

aneSyat
someone would lead or would have led

}

In Sanskrit, these two categories are usually combined, which is why we call
them tense-moods. Sanskrit has {em ten} different tense-moods combinations, and
you can see all ten of them in the examples above.


{h {s prayoga}}

The fourth kind of information is the verb's {s prayoga}. {s prayoga} is
similar to what we call "active voice" and "passive voice" in English. In
Sanskrit, we have {s-dfn kartari prayoga} ("agent usage"), which is like the
English active voice:

{ex

naraH karma karoti.
The man does work.

naraH svapiti.
The man sleeps.

}

{s-dfn karmaNi prayoga} ("object usage"), which is like the English passive
voice:

{ex

nareNa karma [kriyate].
Work [is being done] by the man.

}

and {s-dfn bhAve prayoga} ("stative usage"), which we use instead of {s karmaNi
prayoga} if the verb doesn't use an object. {s bhAve prayoga} looks almost
identical to {s karmaNi prayoga}:

{ex

nareNa [supyate].
[There is sleeping] by the man. (The man sleeps.)

}


{h {s pada}}

The fifth kind of information is the verb's {s pada}. Simply, some verb endings
are called {s-dfn parasmaipada}:

{ex

rAmaz cara[ti]
Rama walks.

}

And some are called {s-dfn Atmanepada}:

{ex

rAmo manya[te]
Rama thinks.

}

For some roots, {s parasmaipada} and {s Atmanepada} endings sometimes imply
different meanings:

{ex

naraH paca[ti]
The man cooks ([for others]).

naraH paca[te]
The man cooks ([for himself]).

}

But often, they don't have any major difference in meaning. We will revisit
{s pada} in a future lesson.
