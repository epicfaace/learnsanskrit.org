{title The eight cases}

Sanskrit has eight different {dfn cases}. These cases can each express many
different meanings, but each has a basic meaning that is easy to remember. And
if we need to, we can modify this basic meaning by using extra uninflected
words.


{h Case 1}
{aka the nominative case, {s prathamA vibhaktiH} ("first division")}

{dfn Case 1} can be thought of as the {em default} case. Usually, it refers to
the subject of the action:

{ex

[siMhaH] khAdati.
[The lion] eats.

}

But this depends on the {s prayoga} of the verb. In the two sentences below,
note the difference in meaning, even though both sentences use case 1:

{ex

[siMhaH] khAdati.
[The lion] eats.
(The lion is the subject of the sentence.)

[siMhaH] khAdyate.
[The lion] is eaten.
(The lion is the object of the sentence.)

}

Case 1 also has special uses in verbless sentences. For details, see the lesson
on verbless sentences:

{ex

[azvaH] kRSNaH.
[The horse] is black.

[azvo] rAmasya.
[The horse] is Rama's.

}


{h Case 2}
{aka the accusative case, {s dvitIyA vibhaktiH} ("second division")}

{dfn Case 2} is generally the {em object} of the action:

{ex

siMho [grAmaM] pazyati.
The lion sees [a village].

}

It is also used for destinations:

{ex

siMho [grAmaM] gacchati.
The lion goes [to the village].

}

Or for time and distance:

{ex

sa [mAsam] adhIte
He studied [for a month].

sa [yojanaM] carati.
He walked [a `yojana].
(A `yojana is around 15 kilometers.)

}

Case 2 is also used with specific uninflected words like {s antarA}, {s
antareNa}, {s Rte}, and {s prati}:

{ex

antarA [gRhaM] ca [vRkSaM] ca gajaH.
There is an elephant between [the house] and [the tree].

antareNa [vidyAM], kiM zakyam?
Without knowledge, what is possible?

Rte 'pi [tvAM] te sukhino bhaviSyanti.
Even without [you], they will be happy.

[gRhaM] prati bhASAmahe.
Let's talk about the house.

}


{h Case 3}
{aka the instrumental case, {s tRtIyA vibhaktiH} ("third division")}

{dfn Case 3} generally means "with" or "by means of":

{ex

siMho [mArgeNa] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [by means of the road].

ahaM [dhanuSA] mRgaM hanmi.
I kill the deer [with (my) bow].

}

For verbs in {s karmaNi} or {s bhAve prayoga}, case 3 defines the agent of
the action:

{ex

[rAmeNa] rAvaNo hanyate
Ravana is killed [by Rama].
(`karmaNi `prayoga)

[mayA] supyate.
I sleep. ("By me, there is sleeping.")
(`bhAve `prayoga)

}

We can also use this case with words like {s saha} ("with") or {s vinA}
("without") to show a sense of accompaniment:

{ex

rAmaH sItayA [saha] vanaM gacchati.
Rama goes to the forest [with] Sita.

rAmo dazarathena [vinA] vanaM gacchati.
Rama goes to the forest [without] Dasharatha.

}


{h Case 4}
{aka the dative case, {s caturthI vibhaktiH} ("fourth division")}

{dfn Case 4} generally means "for" or "for the sake of":

{ex

siMho [mAMsAya] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [for meat].

siMhaH [khAdanAya] grAmaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the village [for eating] ("to eat").

}

For verbs that express anger, jealousy, or blame, case 4 defines the target of
the emotion:

{ex

rAmo [rAvaNAya] krudhyati.
Rama is angry [at Ravana].

kaikeyI [kausalyAyA] IrSyati.
Kaikeyi is jealous [of Kausalya].
(`kausalyAyai becomes `kausalyAyA due to sandhi)

}


{h Case 5}
{aka the ablative case, {s paJcamI vibhaktiH} ("fifth division")}

{dfn Case 5} generally means "from" or "because of":

{ex

naraH [vanAd] grAmaM gacchati.
A man goes [from the forest] to the village.

naraH [bhayAd] gRhaM gacchati.
The man goes home [from (because of) fear].

}

For verbs that express fear or protection, case 5 defines the cause of fear:

{ex

aham [rAvaNAd] bhItaH
I am scared [of Ravana].

aham bAlaM [siMhAd] rakSAmi.
I protect the boy [from the lion].

}

If someone is being born, case 5 defines the father:

{ex

kRSNo [vasudevAd] devakyAM jajJe
Krishna was born [from Vasudeva] in Devaki.

}


In a comparison, case 5 has the sense of "than" or "compared to":

{ex

siMho [narAd] balavattaraH.
The lion is stronger [than the man].

}

Case 5 can also be used with words like {s A} and {s apa}:

{ex

A [vanAt]
up to [the forest]

apa [vanAt]
away from [the forest]

}


{h Case 6}
{aka the genitive case, {s SaSThI vibhaktiH} ("sixth division")}

{dfn Case 6} generally means "of." Generally, it expresses some connection
between two nominals:

{ex

siMho [narasya] gRhaM gacchati.
The lion goes to the house [of the man] (or, [the man's] house).

siMho [narasya] mAMsaM khAdati.
The lion eats the meat [of the man].

}

Generally, case 6 is a "catch-all" case that we use if no other case applies.
In the {cite Ramayana} and the {cite Mahabharata}, it often expresses the same
meanings as case 4:

{ex

rAmaM dehi [tasya].
Give Rama [to him].

}


{h Case 7}
{aka the locative case, {s saptamI vibhaktiH} ("seventh division")}

{dfn Case 7} generally means "in" or "on":

{ex

naro [siMhe] 'sti.
The man is [in the lion].

siMho [grAme] carati.
The lion walks [in the village].

}

If someone is being born, case 7 defines the mother:

{ex

kRSNo vasudevAd [devakyAM] jajJe
Krishna was born from Vasudeva [in Devaki].

}

More abstractly, case 7 describes the {em context} of something:

{ex

[rAme gate] dazaratho duHkhito babhUva
When Rama had gone ([in Rama's having gone]), Dasharatha became unhappy.

[asmin viSaye] ko samarthaH
[In this matter], who is capable?

}


{h Case 8}
{aka the vocative case, {s sambodhana} ("address")}

{dfn Case 8} addresses the person being spoken to:

{ex

he [nara] tvaM khAditaH.
Hey [man]! You have been eaten.

he [siMha] vanaM gaccha.
Hey [lion]! Go to the forest.

}


{h Review}

The eight cases have several other minor uses. But this lesson summarizes the
major patterns you will see and hear.
