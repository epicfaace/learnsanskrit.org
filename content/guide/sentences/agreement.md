{title Agreement}

In a sentence, multiple words might refer to the same idea. For example,
consider these simple sentences:

{ex

rAmaH pRcchati.
Rama asks.

rAmo yodhaH.
Rama is a warrior.

}

In the first sentence, {s rAmaH} shows who performs the action, and {s
pRcchati} shows the action this performer does. In the second sentence, {s
rAmaH} shows who is being described, and {s yodhaH} describes {s rAmaH}.

When two words refer to the same concept, they must use the same gender, case,
number, and person. For example, the sentences below are all incorrect because
their words don't match:

{ex

*rAmaH pRcchanti.
(Number doesn't match.)

*rAmaH pRcchAmi.
(Person doesn't match.)

*rAmo yodham.
(Gender doesn't match.)

*rAmo yodhena.
(Case doesn't match.)

}

This matching is called {dfn agreement}. In this lesson, we will study
agreement in more detail.


{h Agreement of two nominals}

Two nominals that refer to the same idea must have the same gender, case, and
number:

{ex

kRSNaH sarpaH
black snake

kRSNau sarpau
two black snakes

kRSNAH sarpAH
many black snakes

kRSNAya sarpAya
for the black snake

kRSNA sarpI
(female) black snake

}

In each example above, one word is the subject ({s sarpaH}) and the other word
describes it ({s kRSNaH}). The genders, cases, and numbers of these words
completely match.

If the sentence uses a word like {s ca} ("and") to connect multiple nominals,
the describing word should match the number of all of its described words
together:

{ex

rAmo yodhaH.
Rama is a warrior.
(singular number)

rAmo lakSmaNaz ca [yodhau].
Rama and Lakshmana are [warriors].
(dual number)

rAmo lakSmaNo bharataz ca [yodhAH].
Rama, Lakshmana, and Bharata are [warriors].
(plural number)

}

But if the sentence uses a word like {s vA} ("or"), the describing word usually
matches the number of the last word:

{ex

rAmaH satyavAn.
Rama is truthful.

rAmo lakSmaNo vA [satyavAn].
Rama or Lakshmana is truthful.
(masculine case 1 singular to match `lakSmaNa)

rAmo lakSmaNaH sItA vA [satyavatI].
Rama, Lakshmana, or Sita is truthful.
(feminine case 1 singular to match `sItA)

}


{h Agreement of nominal and verb}

The case 1 nominal and the verb must use the same person:

{ex

ahaM carAmi
I walk.

ahaM carye.
I am walked (to).

tvaM carasi
You walk.

tvaM caryase.
You are walked (to).

}

They must also use the same number:

{ex

gajaz carati
The elephant walks.

gajau carataH
The two elephants walk.

gajAz caranti
The elephants walk.

}

This is true even in {s karmaNi prayoga}:

{ex

nareNa gajaz caryate
The elephant is walked to by the man.

nareNa gajau caryete
The two elephants are walked to by the man.

nareNa gajAz caryante
The elephants are walked to by the man.

}

If {s ca} or {s vA} is used, we follow rules similar to those described above:

{ex

rAmo gajaz ca [carataH].
Rama and the elephant [walk].

rAmo gajo vA [carati].
Either Rama or the elephant [walks].

}
