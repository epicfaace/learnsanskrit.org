{title Questions}

In this lesson, we will learn about the different ways we can ask questions in
Sanskrit.


{h {s kim}}

The most straightforward way we can ask a question is to use the pronoun {s-dfn
kim}. {s kim} means "who?" or "what?" and its specific meaning is usually clear
from context. We can use {s kim} to precisely ask about different parts of a
sentence.

For example, suppose someone says the following:

{ex

rAhulo kautUhalAd vAnarAya phalaM dadAti.
Rahula gives the monkey a fruit out of curiosity ("from curiosity").

}

We can use {s kim} to ask a question like this:

{ex

[ko] vAnarAya phalam dadAti.
[Who] gives a fruit to the monkey?

}

Usually, someone would answer like this:

{ex

rAhulaH.
Rahula.

}

Likewise, we can ask other questions and give other answers:

{ex

rAhulaH [kasmai] phalaM dadAti.
[To whom] does Rahula give a fruit?

vAnarAya.
To the monkey.

rAhulo vAnarAya [kiM] dadAti?
[What] does Rahula give the monkey?

phalam.
A fruit.

rAhulaH [kasmAd] vAnarAya phalaM dadAti.
[From what (cause)] does Rahula give a fruit to the monkey?

kautUhalAt.
From curiosity.

}

In many styles of Sanskrit, the word {s kim} can also mean "why." This usage
is very common in the {cite Ramayana} and the {cite Mahabharata}:

{ex

[kiM] mAM hantum icchasi.
[Why] do you want to kill me?

}

{note

{lesson[r=nominals-2/kim-and-yad] lesson on {s kim} and {s yad}}.

{h Yes-no questions}

{dfn Yes-no question} are questions whose answers are usually "yes" or "no."

In Sanskrit, we can ask yes-no questions in many different ways. One common way
is to put the word {s-dfn api} at the beginning of the sentence:

{ex

[api] tvaM sukhI.
Are you happy?

}

Another style is to put the word {s kim} at the beginning or end of the
sentence. If you know Hindi, this is similar to how we use the Hindi word {d
kyA}:

{ex

[kiM] tvaM sukhI.
Are you happy?

tvaM sukhI [kim].
Are you happy?

}

{note

Note that {s kim} might indicate either a yes-no question or "why?" depending
on the context and style. In newer styles of Sanskrit, it usually indicates a
yes-no question.

}

One other style is to use the word {s kaccit}. When we use this word, we hope
or expect that the answer is "yes":

{ex

[kaccit] tvaM sukhI.
Are you happy? (I hope you are.)

}

We can answer these questions in a few different ways. Usually, we repeat part
of the question:

{ex

ahaM sukhI.
I am happy.

ahaM na sukhI.
I am not happy.

}

Or in informal settings, we can use the words {s-dfn Am} ("yes") or {s-dfn na}
("no"):


{h {s kutra}, {s kadA}, and others}

There are various other words that we can use to ask questions. Here are some
common uninflected words:

{table
    {tr {th Word} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr katham}} {td in what way? how?}}
    {tr {td {s-dr kadA}} {td when?}}
    {tr {td {s-dr kimartham}} {td for what reason? why?}}
    {tr {td {s-dr kutaH}} {td from what? for what reason?}}
    {tr {td {s-dr kutra}} {td where?}}
}

And some common adjectives:

{table
    {tr {th Word} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr kiyat}} {td how much?}}
    {tr {td {s-dr kIdRza}} {td of what kind?}}
}
