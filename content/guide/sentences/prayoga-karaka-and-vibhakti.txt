{title {s prayoga}, {s kAraka}, and {s vibhakti}}

In this lesson, we will learn more about {s prayoga} and what different {s
prayoga}s mean. To learn this, we first need to learn about a concept called {s
kAraka}. And to learn about {s kAraka}, we first need know about a concept
called {s vibhakti}.

This lesson is the most theoretical one in our entire guide. We have tried to
make it as simple as possible. But even so, the material here might still be
complex or difficult.


{h {s vibhakti} and {s kAraka}}

Roughly speaking, a nominal's case is the "role" that the nominal plays in the
sentence. For example, case 1 often expresses the subject of some action:

{ex

[gajaH] khAdati.
[The elephant] eats.

}

and case 2 often expresses the object:

{ex

gajaH [phalaM] khAdati.
The elephant eats [a fruit].

}

The idea of "case" combines the two concepts of {s-dfn kAraka} and
{s-dfn vibhakti}. {s vibhakti} is the name for the specific group of endings we
use, and {s kAraka} is the name for the role that those endings express.

What does that mean? We can better understand with an example. Here are the
normal endings of the first {s vibhakti}:

{ex

H au aH

}

Do these endings look familiar? These are the basic nominal endings for case 1.
Likewise, the second {s vibhakti} uses the same endings as case 2, the third
uses the same endings as case 3, and so on up to the seventh {s vibhakti} and
case 7. We stop here because there are only seven {s vibhakti}s.

If there are only seven {s vibhakti}s, what do we do for case 8? For case 8, we
reuse the first {s vibhakti} but with a different meaning.

This is the core idea: on its own, a {s vibhakti} has no meaning. But it can
express different meanings based on context.

For example, the first {s vibhakti} can express the subject of the sentence:

{ex

gajAH khAdanti.
The elephants eat.

}

the object of the sentence:

{ex

gajAH khAdyante.
The elephants are being eaten.

}

or even the audience for the sentence:

{ex

he [gajAH] mA khAdata.
Hey elephants, don't eat!

}

In particular, the first {s vibhakti} can express two ideas called {s-dfn
kartR} ("agent") and {s-dfn karma} ("object"). These two ideas are called {s
kAraka}s, which roughly means that they are part of the verb's action:

{ex

gajAH khAdanti.
The elephants eat.
(`kartR -- the elephants are the ones eating)

gajAH khAdyante.
The elephants are being eaten.
(`karma -- the elephants are the ones being eaten)

}


{h {s prayoga}}

Finally, we can understand what {s prayoga} means. Every Sanskrit verb
expresses some basic role by default. If a verb express {s kartR}, it is called
{s kartari prayoga}, and the case 1 noun expresses {s kartR}:

{ex

khAdanti
They are eating.

gajAH khAdanti.
The elephants are eating.

}

If the verb expresses {s karma}, it is called {s karmaNi prayoga}, and the case
1 noun expresses {s karma}:

{ex

They are being eaten.

gajAH khAdyante
The elephants are being eaten.

}

And if it expresses no role at all, it is called {s bhAve prayoga}

{ex

supyate
There is sleeping.

gajaiH supyate.
The elephants sleep. ("There is sleeping by the elephants.")

}

So, what case 1 really expresses is whatever the {s prayoga} of the verb is.
If the verb is {s kartari prayoga}, it express {s kartR}.
