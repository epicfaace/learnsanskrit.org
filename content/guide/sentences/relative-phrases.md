{title Relative phrases}

{dfn Relative phrases} are phrases like this:

{ex

aham apazyaM naraM [yo gajam acorayat].
I saw the man [who stole the elephant].

sa naro gacchati [yatra bahavo gajA vasanti].
That man is going [where many elephants live].

gajA bhItA bhavanti [yadA coram pazyanti].
Elephants become scared [when they see the thief].

}

Relative phrases are one way we can create complex Sanskrit sentences. In this
lesson, we will learn about many different kinds of relative phrases.


{h {s yad}}

The most straightforward way we can make a relative phrase is to use the
pronoun {s-dfn yad}. We can use it to precisely describe different parts of a
sentence. For example, suppose someone says the following:

{ex

rAhulo nagaraM carati.
Rahula walks to the city.

}

We can make phrase like this:

{ex

rAhulo [yo grAme vasati] nagaraM carati.
Rahula, [who lives in the village], walks to the city.

}

The pronoun {s yad} uses the same gender and number as the word it describes.
But it can use different cases:

{ex

rAhulo [yam mAtA mArgati] nagaraM carati.
Rahula, [whom his mother is searching for], walks to the city.

rAhulo [yasya pitA yodho] nagaraM carati.
Rahula, [whose father is a warrior], walks to the city.

}

To learn more about the specific endings that the {s yad} pronoun uses, see our
{lesson[r=nominals-2/kim-and-yad] lesson on {s kim} and {s yad}}.


{h Using {s yad} with {s tad}}

We can use {s yad} with pronouns like {s-dfn tad} ("that") to create even more
complex sentences. In each sentence below, the highlighted pronouns have the
same gender and number. But by using different cases, we can show different
relationships:

{ex

[yA] pRcchati [sA] rAmasya patnI.
[Who] asks, [she] is Rama's wife. (literal translation)
The person [who] asks is Rama's wife. (natural translation)

[yasyai] rAmaH phalaM dadAti [sA] rAmasya patnI
[To whom] Rama gives a fruit, [she] is Rama's wife. (literal)
The person [to whom] Rama gives a fruit is Rama's wife. (natural)

[yasyai] rAmaH phalaM dadAti [tasyAH] pitA janakaH
[To whom] Rama gives a fruit, [her] father is Janaka. (literal)
The father of the one [to whom] Rama gives a fruit is Janaka. (natural)

}

Note the small difference in emphasis if we switch the order of these pronouns:

{ex

[yA] pRcchati [sA] rAmasya patnI.
The person [who] asks is Rama's wife. (`yA first)

[sA] pRcchati [yA] rAmasya patnI.
She, [who] is Rama's wife, asks. (`sA first)

}

The two English translations are quite different. But the Sanskrit remains
simple and clear.


{h {s yatra}, {s yadA}, and others}

There are various other words that we can use to create relative phrases. Here
are some common uninflected words:

{table
    {tr {th Word} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr yathA}} {td in which way}}
    {tr {td {s-dr yadA}} {td when}}
    {tr {td {s-dr yadartham}} {td for which reason}}
    {tr {td {s-dr yataH}} {td from what, for what reason}}
    {tr {td {s-dr yatra}} {td where}}
}

These words are often paired with the words below:

{table
    {tr {th Word} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tathA}} {td in that way}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tadA}} {td then}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tadartham}} {td for that reason}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tataH}} {td from that, for that reason}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tatra}} {td there}}
}

Likewise, here are some common adjectives:

{table
    {tr {th Word} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr yAvat}} {td so much}}
    {tr {td {s-dr yAdRza}} {td of which kind}}
}

And the adjectives they are often paired with:

{table
    {tr {th Word} {th Meaning}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tAvat}} {td that much}}
    {tr {td {s-dr tAdRza}} {td of that kind}}
}
