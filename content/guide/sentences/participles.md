{title Participles}

In English grammar, the word {dfn participle} refers to certain kinds of verbal
adjectives. The following words are all examples of participles:

{ex

kurvan
while doing

kariSyan
about to do

kRtam
(has been) done

kRtavAn
(has) done

kartavyam
should or must be done

}

Roughly, a participle is just a way to show that we perform one action that
is related to another:

{ex

ahaM [gAyan] carAmi.
I walk [while singing].

rAmaz [caran] cakhAda.
Rama ate [while walking].

}

In this lesson, we will learn more about how these different participles can be
used.


{h Basic participles}

The most basic way to use a participle is as a normal adjective:

{ex

ahaM [nRtyan] gAyAmi.
I sing [while dancing].

ahaM [khAdantaM] siMhaM pazyAmi.
I see a lion [(who is) eating].

}

Since participles are {em verbal} adjectives, they behave somewhat like verbs.
So, we can use them with other nominal words:

{ex

ahaM [rAjJe nRtyan] gAyAmi.
I sing [while dancing for the king].

aham [mAMsam khAdantaM] siMhaM pazyAmi.
I see a lion [(who is) eating meat].

}


{h Simultaneous action with case 7}
{aka the locative absolute}

We often use participles to show that as {em one} action is happening, {em
another} also happens. When we use participles this way, we often imply a
connection between the two actions.

Usually, we show this by using the participle and the word it describes in case
7. For example, if we have these two simple sentences:

{ex

dazarathaH zocati.
Dasharatha grieves

rAmo vanaM gacchati.
Rama goes to the forest.

}

Then we can connect them like so:

{ex

[dazarathe zocati] rAmo vanaM gacchati.
[In Dasharatha grieving], Rama goes to the forest. (literal translation)
[As Dasharatha grieves], Rama goes to the forest. (natural translation)

}

{note
The word {s zocati} here is an adjective in the case 7 singular. It is easily
confused with the normal verb {s zocati}. See our
{lesson[r=nominals-1/consonant-stems] lesson on consonant stems} for details on
why this word looks the way it does.
}

We can use this same structure with other participles too:

{ex

rAme vanaM [gamiSyati] kaikeyI hRSyati.
With Rama [about to go] to the forest, Kaikeyi rejoices.

rAme vanaM [gacchati] kaikeyI hRSyati.
With Rama [going] to the forest, Kaikeyi rejoices.

rAme vanaM [gate] kaikeyI hRSyati.
With Rama [gone] to the forest, Kaikeyi rejoices.

}


{h Simultaneous action with case 6}
{aka the genitive absolute}

Just as we can express simultaneous actions with case 7, we can do the same
with case 6. Usually, the meaning is that one action happens {em in spite of}
or {em even as} another one occurs:

{ex

[dazarathasya zocato] rAmo vanaM gacchati.
[Even as Dasharatha grieves], Rama goes to the forest.

}

{note
The word {s zocataH} here is an adjective in the case 6 singular. It is {em
not} the normal verb {s zocataH}. See our {lesson[r=nominals-1/consonant-stems]
lesson on consonant stems} for details.
