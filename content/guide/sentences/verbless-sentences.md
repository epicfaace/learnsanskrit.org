{title Verbless sentences}

If a sentence has no verb, we assume the verb {s asti} by default. So, the two
sentences below have essentially the same meaning:

{ex

rAmo rAjaputro 'sti.
Rama is a prince.

rAmo rAjaputraH.
Rama (is) a prince.

}

Roughly, there are three types of verbless sentences. In this lesson, we will
learn about these three types.


{h Two nominals in case 1}

The most common verbless sentence has two nominals in case 1. We use this type
of sentence to express that one item {em is} another:

{ex

rAmo rAjaputraH.
Rama (is) a prince.

rAmo balavAn.
Rama is strong.

}


{h Having or owning}

We also commonly see sentences where one noun is in case 6. We use this type
to show that one noun {em owns} or {em has} another:

{ex

dazarathasya putraH.
Dasharatha has a son.

dazarathasya balam.
Dasharatha has strength.

dazarathasya nagaram.
Dasharatha has a city.

dazarathasya sukham.
Dasharatha has happiness.
(Less literally, "Dasharatha is happy.")

}


{h Other sentences}

We can create other verbless sentences by using special uninflected words. Here
is a small example:

{ex

[alam] etena.
Enough of this.

}
