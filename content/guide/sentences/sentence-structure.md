{title Sentence structure}

{dfn Sentences} are meaningful expressions made from of one or more words. Just
as sounds combine to express a meaningful word, words combine to create a
meaningful sentence.

The lessons in this topic will focus on how words interact to create meaning.


{h A basic sentence} 

The most basic Sanskrit sentence is a single verb:

{ex

gacchati.
(Someone) goes.

}

We can add other words to this basic sentence to extend or modify its basic
meaning. For example, we can express who is performing the act of "going" by
adding a nominal word:

{ex

[rAmo] gacchati.
[Rama] goes.

}

We can also specify the destination of the action:

{ex

rAmo [vanaM] gacchati.
Rama goes [to the forest].

}

Or various other kinds of information:

{ex

rAmo [sItayA saha] vanam [ayodhyAyAH pitre] gacchati.
Rama goes [with Sita] to the forest [from Ayodhya for his father]. 

}

As we add more and more nominal words, we add more and more detail to our
original action.


{h Sentence context}

In Sanskrit, we often leave words out of the sentence if the context is clear.
Here are some simple examples:

{ex

rAmo mAtaraM gacchati.
Rama goes to [his] mother.

rAmo hastaM pazyati.
Rama looks at [his] hand.

}

If it is clear from context that {s rAma} is the subject, we can even say this:

{ex

mAtaraM gacchati.
[He] goes to [his] mother.

hastaM pazyati.
[He] looks at [his] hand.

}


{h Verbless sentences}

If we use a verb like {s asti} ("is"), we can express that one thing is
another:

{ex

rAmo rAjaputro ['sti].
Rama [is a] prince.

rAmo balavAn [asti].
Rama [is] strong.

}

If the sentence has no verb, the verb {s asti} is assumed by default. So we can
also rephrase the two examples above to remove {s asti}:

{ex

rAmo rAjaputraH.
Rama [is a] prince.

rAmo balavAn.
Rama [is] strong.

}

Sentences without a verb are sometimes called {dfn verbless} sentences. We will
learn more about these in a future lesson.
