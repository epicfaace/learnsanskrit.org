{title {s -tum}}
{aka the infinitive, {s tumun}}

In this lesson, we will learn about the root suffix {s -tum}, which creates
uninflected words.

When added to some root that means "X," {s-dfn -tum} creates a word that means
"to X." Here are some examples:

{ex

ahaM [khAditum] icchAmi.
I want [to eat].

etAn na [hantum] icchAmi.
I don't want [to kill] them.
(Bhagavad Gita 1.34)

}

We almost always use {s -tum} with another verb. Often, we use {s -tum} words
to express that someone wants to do something:

{ex

gajaH [khAditum] icchati.
The elephant wants [to eat].

}

But there are many other verbs that we can use with {s -tum}:

{ex

gajaH khAdituM [zaknoti].
The elephant [is able] to eat.

gajaH khAdituM [jAnAti].
The elephant [knows (how)] to eat.

gajaH khAditum [Arabhate].
The elephant [begins] to eat.

gajaH khAdituM [yatate].
The elephant [tries] to eat.

gajaH khAditum [arhati].
The elephant [deserves] to eat.

}

And in a more general way, {s -tum} can show the reason that some action was
done:

{ex

gajaH khAdituM carati.
The elephant walks (in order) to eat.

gajaH khAdituM dhAvati.
The elephant runs (in order) to eat.


}


{h Sound changes}

When we add {s -tum}, we strengthen the root's vowel to the medium level. As
usual, some roots don't use {s iT}:

{ex

nI > netum
lead > to lead

}

and others do:

{ex

vand > vanditum
venerate > to venerate

}

Otherwise, {s -tum} generally causes similar sound changes to {s -tvA}:

{ex

budh > boddhum
awaken > to awaken

muc > moktum
free > to free

gai > gAtum
sing > to sing

}

{h Review}

{s -tum} is a common suffix that is worth knowing well.
