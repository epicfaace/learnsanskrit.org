{title The suffix system}

{dfn Suffixes} are meaningful groups of sounds that we add to something else.
Sanskrit uses many different suffixes, and these suffixes can cause many
different sound changes. So it is important to understand what suffixes mean
and what sound changes they cause.

We have already seen several kinds of suffixes. We have seen nominal endings:

{ex

nara + [sya] > narasya
of the man

}

verb endings:

{ex

gaccha + [ti] > gacchati
(someone) goes

}

and various other suffixes that we use with verbs:

{ex

nI + [i] > nAyi > nAyayati
lead > make lead > makes lead

}

But in this topic, we'll focus on all of the {em other} suffixes that Sanskrit
has. These suffixes usually make new nominal words:

{ex

man + tra > mantra
think + (means) > "means of thinking," mantra, counsel

}


{h Root and nominal suffixes}

We can sort these suffixes into two big groups. First are {dfn root suffixes},
which we add to a verb root:

{ex

man + tra > mantra
think + (means) > "means of thinking," mantra, counsel

nI + tra > netra
lead + (means) > "means of leading," an eye

}

Next are {dfn nominal suffixes}, which we usually add to a nominal stem:

{ex

mantra + in > mantrin
mantra + (characterized by) > minister, counselor

amara + tva > amaratva
immortal + (state of being) > immortality

kuru + a > kaurava
Kuru + (descendant of) > "descendant of Kuru," a Kaurava
(one of the main factions described in the Mahabharata)

}

{h What sound changes do suffixes cause?}

As you can see in the examples above, suffixes can cause many different changes
to the roots and stems they attach to.

The most common change is to {em strengthen} the last vowel by making it a
compound vowel. We saw an example of this with {s netra} above:

{ex

nI + tra > netra
lead + (means) > "means of leading," an eye

}

But suffixes can also cause other kinds of sound changes. For example, some
suffixes don't cause a vowel change at all:

{ex

nI + ta > nIta
lead + (past suffix) > (has been) led

}

And others cause the letters {s c} and {s j} to shift to {s k} and {s g}:

{ex

zuc + a > zoka
grieve + (state) > grief, sorrow

tyaj + a > tyAga
abandon + (state) > abandoning, relinquishment

}


{h {s iT}}

When we add a suffix to a root, sometimes we add an extra {s i} sound between
the root and the suffix:

{ex

nI + ta > nIta
lead > led

vand + [i] + ta > vandita
venerate > venerated

}

Traditionally, this {s i} sound is called {s-dfn iT}. Some roots use {s iT},
some roots don't use {s iT}, and some roots use {s iT} optionally.
