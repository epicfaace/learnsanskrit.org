{title {s -at}, {s -Ana}, and {s -vas}}

{note
This lesson depends on content from {topic Nominals 1}, {topic Verbs 1}, and
{topic Verbs 2}.
}

The three suffixes {s -at}, {s -Ana}, and {s -vas} all create nominal stems.
We attach these suffixes to verb {em stems} instead of verb {em roots}. Here
are some examples of how these suffixes attach to stems of the root {s kR}:

{ex

kuru + at > kurvat
do > while doing (`parasmaipada)

kuru + Ana > kurvANa
do > while doing (`Atmanepada)

kariSya + at > kariSyat
do > about to do

cakR + vas > cakRvas
do > has done

}


{h {s -at}}
{aka the present or future active participle, {s zatR}}

The meaning of {s-dfn -at} depends on the stem we attach it to. If we attach it
to a present tense stem, we get a word that means "while doing X":

{ex

gaccha > gacchat
while going

kuru > kurvat
while doing

}

If we attach it to a simple future tense stem, we get a word that usually means
"about to do X":

{ex

gamiSya > gamiSyat
will go > about to go

kariSya > kariSyat
will do > about to do

}

We can use {s -at} only with roots that use {s parasmaipada} endings.

Generally, nominal stems that end in {s -at} use two stems: a {dfn strong stem}
that ends in {s -ant} and a {dfn weak stem} that ends in {s -at}. Certain
endings use the strong stem:

{ex

ahaM [carantaM] naraM pazyAmi
I see the man [who is walking].
(strong stem)

}

And others use the weak stem:

{ex

ahaM [caratA] nareNa saha vadAmi.
I speak with the man [who is walking].
(weak stem)

}

However, roots from the {s hu} class use {s -at} as their only stem:

{ex

juhu > juhvat
while offering

}


{h {s -Ana}}
{aka the present or future middle participle, {s zAnac}}


{s-dfn -Ana} has the same meaning and usage as {s -at}. The difference is that
we use {s -Ana} with roots that use {s Atmanepada} endings:

{ex

kuru > kurvANa
while doing (`Atmanepada)

}

Stems that end with {s -a} use {s -mAna} instead:

{ex

naya > nayamAna
lead > while leading

neSya > neSyamAna
will lead > about to lead

kariSya > kariSyamAna
will do > about to do

}


{h {s -vas}}
{aka the perfect active participle, {s kvasu~}}

{s-dfn vas} is a rare suffix that we use only with the stem of the distant past
tense. Usually, it creates stems that mean "has done X":

{ex

cakR > cakRvas
did > did or has done

}

We can use {s -vas} only if the root can use {s parasmaipada} endings:

{ex

jagm > jagmivas
went > went or has gone

tasth > tasthivas
stood > stood or has stood

}

Otherwise, we use {s -Ana}:

{ex

cakR > cakrANa
did > did or has done (`Atmanepada)

}


{h Review}

The {s -at} and {s -Ana} endings are common and worth knowing well. For
details, see our {topic Sentences} topic.
