{title {s -tvA} and {s -ya}}
{aka the gerund, the absolutive, the indeclinable or adverbial participle}

We will start this topic by learning about the root suffixes {s -tvA} and {s
-ya}. Both of these suffixes create uninflected words. 


{h {s -tvA}}
{aka {s ktvA}}

When added to some root that means "X," {s-dfn -tvA} creates a word that means
"after X-ing." In other words, {s -tvA} shows that one action happens before
another.

For example, suppose we have these two simple sentences:

{ex

rAmo laGkAM gacchati.
Rama goes to Lanka.

rAmo rAvaNaM pazyati.
Rama sees Ravana.

}

We can combine them like so:

{ex

rAmo laGkAM [gatvA] rAvaNaM pazyati
Rama, [after going] to Lanka, sees Ravana.

}

{s -tvA} can cause many sandhi changes. We will discuss these sandhi changes
further below.


{h {s -ya}}
{aka {s lyap}}

{s-dfn -ya} has the same meaning as {s -tvA}. If the root uses a verb prefix,
we always use {s -ya}. Otherwise, we use {s -tvA}.

For example, if we have these two simple sentences:

{ex

hanumAn rAmaM pratigacchati.
Hanuman returns to Rama.

hanumAn hRSyati.
Hanuman rejoices.

}

Then we can combine them with {s -ya}:

{ex

hanumAn rAmaM [pratigamya] hRSyati.
Hanuman, [after returning] to Rama, rejoices.

}

If the root ends in a short vowel, then we add an extra {s -t} after the root:

{ex

AhR > AhRtya
fetch > after fetching

}


{h Sound changes for {s -tvA}}

Unlike many suffixes, {s -tvA} does not strengthen the root's vowel:

{ex

nI > nItvA
lead > after leading

bhU > bhUtvA
become > after becoming

kR > kRtvA
do > after doing

}

As usual, some roots use the connecting {s iT} sounds and others do not. Here
are some roots that use {s iT}:

{ex

vand > vanditvA
venerate > after venerating

paTh > paThitvA
read, recite > after reading or reciting

}

If a root ends in a consonant and does not use {s iT}, then the root's last
consonant sound might contact the {s -t} in {s -tvA}. This contact causes many
sandhi changes.

For example, if the root's last sound is a voiced aspirated consonant ({s gh jh
Dh dh bh h}), {s -tvA} usually becomes {s -dhvA}:

{ex

labh > labdha
obtain > obtained

budh > buddha
awake > awakened

dah > dagdhvA
burn > after burning

}

A root's last {s -c} usually becomes {s -k}:

{ex

muc > mukta
free, release > freed, released

}

And its last {s -j} usually becomes either {s -k} or {s -S}:

{ex

yuj > yuktvA
yoke, join > after yoking or joining

mRj > mRSTvA
wipe, polish, clean > after wiping, polishing, or cleaning

}

Roots that end in {s -A}, {s -e}, or {s -ai} often use {s -i} or {s -I} for
their vowels:

{ex

sthA > sthitvA
stand > after standing

gai > gItvA
sing > after singing

}

Some roots that end in {s -m} or {s -n} lose that sound:

{ex

gam > gatvA
go > after going

han > hatvA
kill > after killing

man > matvA
think > after thinking

}

For some roots, their semivowels become vowels and any other vowel sounds they
have are removed. This change is called {s-dfn samprasAraNa}. Here are some
examples:

{ex

vac > uktvA
speak > after speaking

svap > suptvA
sleep > after sleeping

yaj > iSTvA
sacrifice > after sacrificing

grah > gRhItvA
grab > after grabbing

vas > uSitvA
live > after living

prach > pRSTvA
ask > after asking

}

And there are other irregular changes too:

{ex

dA > dattvA
give > after giving

}


{h Review}

{s -tvA} and {s -ya} are common suffixes that are worth knowing well.
