{title Other root suffixes}

In this lesson, we will learn about some other common root suffixes. For ease
of reference, we will discuss these suffixes in alphabetical order:

{ex

a aka ana in tR tra

}


{h {s -a}}
{aka {s ghaJ}}

{s-dfn -a} creates abstract nouns that use masculine endings. When we add {s
-a} to a root that means "X," we get words that mean "the state of X-ing":

{ex

bhU > bhAva
be, become > the state of being or becoming; existence

mR > mAra
die > death

Anand > Ananda
feel blissful > bliss

}

In this sense, {s -a} often causes a root's final {s c} and {s j} sounds to
become {s k} and {s g}:

{ex

yuj > yoga

zuc > zoka
grieve > grief, sorrow

tyaj > tyAga
abandon > abandonment, relinquishment

}


{h {s -aka}}
{aka {s Nvul}}

{s-dfn aka} (feminine {s ikA}) creates adjectives. When we add {s -aka} to a
root that means "X," we get words that mean "one who does X":

{ex

kR > kAraka
do > doer

pac > pAcaka
cook > cooker

}


{h {s -ana}}
{aka {s lyuT}, {s lyu}}

{s-dfn -ana} usually creates abstract neuter nouns. When we add {s -ana} to a
root that means "X," we get words that mean "the act of doing X":

{ex

kR > karaNa
do > act of doing; action

i > ayana
go > act of going; journey

mR > maraNa
die > act of dying; death

}

{s -ana} also creates adjectives (feminine {s -anI}) that mean "one who does
X":

{ex

kR > karaNa
do > one that does or causes; the mean of an action

mRd > mardana
crush > one who crushes or pulverizes

}


{h {s -in}}

{s-dfn -in} (feminine {s -inI}) creates adjectives that mean "one who does X":

{ex

kR > kArin
do > doing

}


{h {s -tR}}
{aka {s tRc}}

{s-dfn -tR} (feminine {s -trI}) creates adjectives that mean "one who does X":

{ex

kR > kartR
do > doer, agent

nI > netR
lead > leader

yudh > yoddhR
fight > fighter

}

{aside
The case 7 singular of {s kartR} is {s kartari}. We have seen this word in the
phrase {s kartari prayoga} ("usage in (the sense of) agent").
}


{h {s -tra}}
{aka {s STran}}

{s-dfn -tra} usually creates neuter nouns with the sense of "the means of doing
X":

{ex

nI > netra
lead > by which one is led; an eye

man > mantra
think > by which thought occurs; a mantra

}
