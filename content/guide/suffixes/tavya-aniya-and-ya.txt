{title {s -tavya}, {s -anIya}, and {s -ya}}
{aka the gerundive, the future passive participle, the potential participle, {s
kRtyAH}}

The suffixes {s-dfn tavya}, {s-dfn anIya}, and {s-dfn ya} all create
adjectives, and they all have the same meaning. When added to a root that means
"X," they all mean "should or must be X-ed" or "able to be X-ed."

Here are some examples:

{ex

tvayA vanaM [gantavyam].
By you, the forest [must be gone to]. (literal translation)
You [must go] to the forest. (natural translation)

mRgo na [hantavyaH].
The deer [must] not [be killed].

}


{h {s bhAve prayoga}}

These suffixes often express {s bhAve prayoga}. When they do, they use the
neuter case 1 singular:

{ex

yoddhavyam
There should or must be fighting.

}

Here is an example from the {cite Bhagavad Gita}:

{ex

kair mayA saha [yoddhavyam]
With whom and me [must there be fighting]? (literal translation)
With whom [must I fight]? (natural translation)

}


{h {s -tavya}}
{aka {s tavya} or {s tavyat}}

To add {s -tavya}, we follow the same rules as {s -tum}. As usual, some roots
use {s iT} and some do not:

{ex

nI > netavya
should or must be led

vand > vanditavya
should or must be venerated

}

And as usual, roots that end in consonant sounds might undergo many sandhi
changes:

{ex

budh > boddhavya

yudh > yoddhavya

}


{h {s -anIya}}
{aka {s anIyar}}

{s-dfn -anIya} strengthens the root's vowel to the medium level. Otherwise, it
does not cause any special sound changes.

{ex

kR > karaNIya
do > should or must be done

dRz > darzanIya
do > should or must be seen


}


{h {s -ya}}
{aka {s yat}, {s Nyat}, {s kyap}, ...}

{s-dfn -ya} causes various sound changes. Here are some examples:

{ex

gai > geyam
sing > should or must be sung

pA > peyam
drink > should or must be drunk

labh > labhya
obtain > should or must be obtained

zak > zakya
be able to > able to be done, possible

sah > sahya
endure > endurable

kR > kArya
do > should or must be done

}
