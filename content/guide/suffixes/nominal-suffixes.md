{title Nominal suffixes}

In this lesson, we will learn about some common nominal suffixes. For ease of
reference, we will discuss these suffixes in alphabetical order:

Unless we mention otherwise, none of these suffixes cause any sound changes.

{ex

a in ka tama tara tas tA tva mat maya ya vat

}


{h {s -a}}
{aka {s aN}}

{s-dfn -a} often creates adjectives that mean "descending from X" or "of X."
Usually, we strengthen the stem's first vowel to the strongest level. And if
the stem ends in {s -a}, we remove the last {s -a}:

{ex

kuru + a > kaurava
descending from Kuru; a Kaurava

indra + a > aindra
of Indra

}


{h {s -in}}

{s-dfn -in} (feminine: {s -inI}) creates adjectives that mean "characterized by
X." If the stem ends in {s -a}, we remove the last {s -a}.

{ex

yoga + in > yogin
yoga > characterized by yoga; a yogi

yoga + inI > yoginI
yoga > a female yogi; a yogini

}


{h {s -ka}}

{s-dfn -ka} often creates stems that mean "a little X" or "a dear X":

{ex

putra + ka > putraka
son > little son, dear son 

}


{h {s -tama}}
{aka {s tamap}, {s gha}}

{s-dfn -tama} (feminine: {s -tamA}) creates adjectives that mean "most X":

{ex

balavat + tama > balavattama
strong > strongest

}


{h {s -tara}}
{aka {s tarap}, {s gha}}

{s-dfn -tara} (feminine: {s -tarA}) creates adjectives that mean "more X":

{ex

sundara + tara > sundaratara
beautiful > more beautiful

}


{h {s -tas}}
{aka {s tasi~}}

{s-dfn -tas} creates an uninflected word that means "from X." Due to sandhi, it
becomes {s -taH}:

{ex

agni > agnitaH
fire > from the fire

}


{h {s -tA}}
{aka {s tal}}

{s-dfn -tA} creates feminine nouns that maen "X-ness" or "the state of being X":

{ex

yogya + tA > yogyatA
useful, appropriate > utility, propriety

}


{h {s -tva}}

{s-dfn -tva} has the same meaning as {s tA}, but it creates neuter stems:

{ex

amara + tva > amaratva
immortal > immortality

sama + tva > samatva
same, even > sameness, evenness, equanimity

}


{h {s -mat}}
{aka {s matu~p}}

{s-dfn -mat} (feminine: {s -matI}) creates adjectives that mean "possessing X"
or "characterized by X." Certain stems use {s -vat} instead. See our notes on
{s -vat} for details.

{ex

hanu + mat > hanumat
jaw > characterized by (prominent) jaws; Hanuman

}


{h {s -maya}}

{s-dfn -maya} (feminine: {s -mayI}) creates adjectives that mean "made of X":

{ex

hiraNya + maya > hiraNyamaya
gold > made of gold, golden

}


{h {s -ya}}

{s-dfn -ya} creates neuter nouns with an abstract sense. Usually, we strengthen
the stem's first vowel to the strongest level:

{ex

sadRza > sAdRzya
similar (to) > similarity

}


{h {s -vat}}
{aka {s vatu~p}}

{s-dfn -vat} (feminine: {s -vatI}) has the same meaning as {s -mat}. We use {s
-vat} if the stem ends in {s m} or {s a}, or if it has {s m} or {s a} as its
next-to-last letter:

{ex

bhaga + vat > bhagavat
(`a is the last letter)

lakSmI + vat > lakSmIvat
(`m is the next-to-last letter)

}
