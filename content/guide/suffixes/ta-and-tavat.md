{title {s -ta} and {s -tavat}}

In this lesson, we will learn about two more common suffixes. Both of these
suffixes create adjectives.


{h {s -ta}}
{aka the past passive participle, the PPP, {s kta}}

The suffix {s-dfn -ta} is important and powerful. When we add it to a root that
means "X," we usually create words that mean "(has) been X-ed."

Here are some examples of {s -ta}. Note that it causes the same sound changes
as {s -tvA}:

{ex

nI > nIta
lead > led

kR > kRta
do, make > done, made

}

{s -ta} usually creates words that express {s karmaNi prayoga}. In English, we
would say that these words have a {em passive} sense:

{ex

rAmeNa zaraH [kRtaH].
By Rama, an arrow [has been made].

}

But if the root implies a sense of motion, it has the normal {s kartari
prayoga} sense:

{ex

gam > gata
go > (has) gone

}

And likewise for other roots, especially if they don't have an object:

{ex

budh > buddha
awaken > (has) awakened

}

Finally, there are some roots where {s -ta} has a more general sense:

{ex

zak > zakta
be able to > able, capable

}


{h {s -tavat}}
{aka the past active participle, {s ktavatu~}}

The suffix {s-dfn -tavat} has a similar meaning to {s -ta}. When we add it to a
root that means "X," we usually create words that mean "has X-ed." Here are
some examples:

{ex

zru > zrutavat
hear > has heard

}

{s -tavat} causes all the same sound changes that {s -ta} does.
