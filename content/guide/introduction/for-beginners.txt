{title For beginners}

{dfn Sanskrit} is an ancient Indian language that is still spoken and written
today, and {dfn grammar} is the name for a language's rules. Our guide to
Sanskrit grammar uses clear and simple language, and it does not expect any
special background knowledge. At the same time, our guide is as complete and
comprehensive as any textbook on the market today.


{h Acquiring and studying}

First, we want to tell you something very important about language learning:

{note
There are two ways we can develop skill in a language: we can {dfn acquire} it
or we can {dfn study} it. Acquiring and studying need different methods and
produce different results.
}

Someone who has {em acquired} Sanskrit can understand Sanskrit as quickly and
easily as you can understand this sentence. We acquire Sanskrit by engaging
with Sanskrit content (such as stories and conversations) that we enjoy and
understand.

Someone who has {em studied} Sanskrit can deeply explain how Sanskrit words and
sentences work and what rules they follow. We study Sanskrit by learning and
practicing grammar rules.

Our guide focuses on {em studying} Sanskrit and not on {em acquiring} it. So if
you want to acquire Sanskrit, we strongly recommend that you use the resources
below:

{ul
    {li {a[href=https://en.amarahasa.com] Amarahāsa}: free online stories written
    especially for acquiring Sanskrit.}
    {li Samskrita Bharati ({a[href=https://www.samskritabharati.in/] India},
    {a[href=https://samskritabharatiusa.org] US}): Conversational Sanskrit.
    Includes workshops, classes, correspondence courses, and in-person events.}
    {li {a[href=https://www.sanskritfromhome.in/] Vyoma-Saṃskṛta-Pāṭhaśālā}:
    Online Sanskrit lectures in a classroom format.}
}

You can find more resources {url[r=site.resources] on our site's Resources
page}.


{h What our guide can and cannot do for you}

There are countless resources for learning Sanskrit grammar. Why create
another? We created our guide because we could not find a resource that was:

{ul

{li clear and simple}
{li complete and useful}
{li easy to search}
{li delightful to the eye and ear}
{li freely available}

}

Most importantly, we believe that a guide should do one thing well rather than
two things acceptably. Acquiring and studying Sanskrit need radically different
approaches, and we do not think they should be mixed in one resource.

Think of our guide as a {em map} of Sanskrit. A map gives you a basic sense of
the world around you. A map is useful if you don't know where you are. But
even the best map cannot replace the real world.

Our guide can give you a basic sense of Sanskrit, and it can help you
understand the words and sentences you see. But it cannot convey what real
Sanskrit is like, because {em no grammar resource can}. At some point, you must
engage with real Sanskrit content. And that means {em acquiring} Sanskrit
rather than just studying it.

If you have {em any} interest in reading Sanskrit (as opposed to slowly
translating it), we urge you to pair our guide with a resource that focuses on
acquisition. Just as a map is secondary to the real world, let our guide be
secondary to the content you experience.


{h How our guide is structured}

Our guide has a tree structure. Its trunk is a list of {dfn core lessons} that
conveys Sanskrit's core principles, and its branches are the different {dfn
topics} we use to describe Sanskrit's systems in detail. Once you finish our
core lessons, you can read the rest of the guide's topics in whatever order you
like. {em You} decide what you want to study.

Each lesson in our guide covers one concept or a small set of related concepts.
We make each concept clear and concrete by including multiple examples.
Finally, we end the lesson with a short review about the lesson's main ideas.

We focus on concepts, {em not} on busywork. This means our guide has:

{ul
  {li {em no} translation exercises}
  {li {em no} vocabulary lists}
  {li {em no} word drills}
  {li {em no} memorization tasks}
}

It may be a shock to you that our guide avoids these devices. Many Sanskrit
resources love and rely on them, and we used to love and rely on them too.
But ultimately, it is {em far} more effective and {em far} more enjoyable to
engage with meaningful content that focuses on acquisition.

Many resources also use complicated technical language to describe Sanskrit.
Technical language is sometimes necessary. But as much as possible, we use
simple and clear language that ordinary people can understand. And for each
concept we discuss, we include plenty of examples to make the discussion clear
and concrete.

In case it is useful to you, lessons after the core lessons will also include
the standard English and Sanskrit terms for each concept. These terms will help
you more easily use other resources outside of our guide.


{h How to use our guide}

It's simple:

{ol

{li {p {strong Read the core lessons and answer all of their review questions.}
These core lessons are the foundation for the rest of the guide, so it is
important to study them well. A tree with a weak trunk will wither and crumble,
but a tree with a strong trunk will endure and thrive.}}

{li {p {strong Once you understand the core lessons, read any topic you like.}
Choose any topic you like. When reading a topic, make sure to read its lessons
in order. This is because each lesson in a topic builds on the previous ones.}

Learning Sanskrit is easier and more fun when you have friends to help you.
So please {url[r=site.contact] write to us} with questions, comments, or
anything else you want us to know. We love receiving email, and we will send
you a reply as soon as we can.


{note
Since it is important, we will say this again: we {strong strongly} recommend
that you pair this guide with a resource that focuses on acquisition. If you
find a word or phrase that you do not understand, you can always read our guide
for help, just as you might read a map when you are lost.
}


{h What to use if you don't like our guide}

No resource is perfect for everybody. If you have decided that our guide is not
right for your needs, we have other resources we can recommend. Please also
{url[r=site.contact] let us know} what you wish our guide could offer you.

If you want to acquire Sanskrit, we recommend the resources we mentioned above.
Or if you ultimately feel most comfortable with the textbook format, here are
the English-language textbooks we recommend for beginners:

{ul
    {li {cite Introduction to Sanskrit Volumes I and II} by Thomas Egenes. This
    simple and gentle series explains Sanskrit grammar bit by bit.}
    {li {cite The Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit} by Antonia Ruppel. This
    beautiful work is friendly, methodical, and clear, and it is an excellent
    follow-up to the Egenes set above.}
}

page}.


{h About the author}

Sanskrit is like a massive and beautiful forest. Many of the people who enter
this forest get tangled in a jungle of complicated explanations. And a few
unlucky travelers are eaten by the tigers of anxiety, boredom, doubt, and
frustration. I created this guide to give ordinary people a clear and enjoyable
path through that forest. 

I used to believe that grammar was the only way to learn Sanskrit. I now
believe that most Sanskrit learners should focus on {em acquiring} Sanskrit
rather than {em studying} it. But there will always be people who love and
appreciate grammar, just as I do. And there is certainly a need for a resource
that explains Sanskrit clearly, simply, and completely.

I dedicate this guide to my grandparents: B. Raghavachari, Mohana Raghavachari,
the late S. Rangaswamy, and the late Malathi Rangaswamy. I also decidate it to
you, and to all those who love and learn Sanskrit.
