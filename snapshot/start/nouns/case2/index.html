<h1>Case 2: The Object</h1>
<P class="alternatives">Also known as: the accusative case, <span lang="sa">dvitīyā vibhakti</span> ("second division")</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few lessons ago, we studied the case that is used to define a verb's subject. Now we will learn the case that is used to define a verb's object. For simplicity, let's call this case the <dfn>object case</dfn>, or <dfn>case 2</dfn> for short.</p>

<p>Take a look at the example sentences below. (These sentences have not had the sandhi rules applied.)</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">नराः <strong>बालान्</strong> तुदन्ति</p>
	<p lang="sa">narāḥ <strong>bālān</strong> tudanti</p>
	<p>The men strike <strong>the boys</strong>.</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev">कृष्णः <strong>वीरम्</strong> पृच्छति</p>
	<p lang="sa">kṛṣṇaḥ <strong>vīram</strong> pṛcchati</p>
	<p>Krishna asks <strong>the hero</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The object case is also used to show that action is done "to" or "toward" something:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">अर्जुनः <strong>अश्वम्</strong> गच्छति</p>
	<p lang="sa">arjunaḥ <strong>aśvam</strong> gacchati</p>
	<p>Arjuna goes <strong>to the horse</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="ling box">
<p>You might be familiar with the English word "whom," which is used in expressions like "for whom" and "from whom." The word "whom" can also be used by itself, without a word like "for" or "from." But what does "whom" really mean?</p>

<p>The answer is actually quite simple: the word "whom" is like the "object case" version of the word "who." The rarity of "whom" in English illustrates the fact that inflection has continued to disappear from the English language. "Whom" is often used incorrectly by those who try to make themselves sound educated; sentences like <q>Whom do you think you are?</q> are ungrammatical.</p>

<p>So, where should "whom" be used? It is used whenever the idea of "who" is not in the subject case. So, we have <q>Who do you think you are?</q>, but we also have <q>Whom did you see?</q>, <q>I am the person whom you approach</q>, and <q>Of whom do you speak?</q> The words "me," "him," "her," and "them" are used in many of the same situations as "whom" &mdash; consider <q>Did you see me?</q>, <q>You approach him,</q> <q>You speak of him</q> &mdash; but "whom" is much less common.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, this is the full extent of object-case inflection in modern English.</p>

<h2>Inflection</h2>
<table class="inflection">
	<caption>-a (masculine)</caption>
	<tr><th class="stem">गज</th>
		<th>Singular</th>
		<th>Dual</th>
		<th>Plural</th>
	</tr><tr><th>Case 1 (subject)</th>
		<td>गजः<div>gajaḥ</div></td>
		<td class="r">गजौ<div>gajau</div></td>
		<td>गजाः<div>gajāḥ</div></td>
	</tr><tr><th>Case 2 (object)</th>
		<td>गजम्<div>gajam</div></td>
		<td class="r">गजौ<div>gajau</div></td>
		<td>गजान्<div>gajān</div></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The dual endings for case 1 and case 2 are <strong>the same!</strong> As we proceed with our study of the Sanskrit noun, you'll find that many of the noun endings are not unique. But in a normal sentence, other words usually provide enough context for you to understand a word's meaning.</p>

<h2>Compound vowel sandhi</h2>
<p>When we <a href="sandhi">first talked about sandhi</a>, we restricted ourselves to the simple vowels <strong>only</strong>. Now we will talk about what happens if the first vowel is a compound vowel. The rule is as follows:</p>

<p class="rule box">In front of any vowel, a compound vowel has its second vowel sound changed to a semivowel. Remember that <span lang="sa">e, ai, o,</span> and <span lang="sa">au</span> are treated as <span lang="sa">*ai, *āi, *au,</span> and <span lang="sa">*āu</span> for historical reasons.</p>

<p>Does this rule look familiar? Maybe you'll recognize it if I bring this table back <a href="/sounds/vowels/compound">from the second lesson of the guide</a>:</p>

<table lang="sa" class="blue">
	<tr lang="en"><th>Weak</th><th>Medium</th><th>Strong</th></tr>
	<tr><td>i, ī</td><td>*ai</td><td>*āi</td></tr>
	<tr><td>u, ū</td><td>*au</td><td>*āu</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ṛ, ṝ</td><td>*ar</td><td>*ār</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This "special rule for complex vowels" is really the same rule that makes <span lang="sa">gacchaty aśvaḥ</span>. The second vowel sound changes to a semivowel and produces the result we have above. This sandhi rule seems to indicate that the "old" vowel forms really did once exist.</p>

<p>You might not realize it, but you've seen this rule in practice already: in verbs like <span lang="sa">bhavati</span> and <span lang="sa">nayati</span>! It's easier to say that the roots of these verbs are <span lang="sa">bhav</span> and <span lang="sa">nay</span>, and that's the system we've followed; <strong>but</strong>, it's just as valid to say that the roots are <span lang="sa">bho</span> and <span lang="sa">ne</span>. These roots would change because of the <span lang="sa">a</span> that we add to make the verb stem:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">भो + अ + ति → भवति</p>
	<p lang="sa">bho + a + ti → bhavati</p>
	<p>He becomes.</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev">ने + अ + ति → नयति</p>
	<p lang="sa">ne + a + ti → nayati</p>
	<p>He leads.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span lang="sa">-e</span> in external sandhi</h3>
<p>The word <span lang="sa">te</span>, which is the masculine plural of <span lang="sa">tad</span> in case 1, ends in <span lang="sa">-e</span>. Words that end in <span lang="sa">e</span> follows a special sandhi rule. The rule is a little arbitrary, but it's straightforward.</p>

<p>First, recall the general rule for final compound vowels:</p>
<blockquote>In front of any vowel, a compound vowel has its second vowel sound changed to a semivowel. Remember that <span lang="sa">e, ai, o,</span> and <span lang="sa">au</span> are treated as <span lang="sa">*ai, *āi, *au,</span> and <span lang="sa">*āu</span> for historical reasons.</blockquote>
<p>Our new <span lang="sa">-e</span> sandhi rule extends the rule above:</p>

<p class="rule box">In external sandhi, <span lang="sa">e</span> "drops" the semivowel. But when <span lang="sa">e</span> is in front of <span lang="sa">a-</span>, <span lang="sa">e</span> stays the same and the <span lang="sa">a-</span> disappears. No other changes occur.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">ते गच्छन्ति → ते गच्छन्ति</p>
	<p lang="sa">te gacchanti → te gacchanti</p>
	<p>They go.</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev">ते इच्छन्ति → त इच्छन्ति</p>
	<p lang="sa">te icchanti → ta icchanti</p>
	<p>They want.</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev">ते अश्वाः → ते ऽश्वाः</p>
	<p lang="sa">te aśvāḥ → te 'śvāḥ</p>
	<p>They are horses.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the letter <span lang="sa">a</span> is removed because of the influence of the big and powerful <span lang="sa">e</span>.</p>

<h2>Devanagari: Conjunct Consonants</h2>
<p>Two consonants are <dfn>conjunct</dfn> when they are next to each other. For example, <span lang="sa">tarati</span> has no conjunct consonants, whereas <span lang="sa">taranti</span> has two: <span lang="sa">n</span> is conjunct to <span lang="sa">t</span>. In Devanagari, <strong>conjunct consonants do strange things</strong>. They form strange combinations that are sometimes much different from the two original letters.</p>

<p>It takes a considerable amount of time to get used to these combinations, but the truth is that most of them can be read on the first try. For instance, consider <span class="dev">न्त</span>. How would you read this combination? You might notice that the two letters are <span class="dev">न</span> and <span class="dev">त</span>, except that the <span class="dev">न</span> seems to be attached to <span class="dev">त</span>. So, you might suspect that this is a combination of consonants, leading you to conclude that <span class="dev">न्त</span> is <span lang="sa">nta</span> — correctly! Most of the other conjunct consonants are just as simple, but a few are slightly more complex.</p>

<h3>Special Combinations</h3>
<p>The conjunct consonants featured here have combined so much that it is impossible to recognize them in the result. Both of these combinations are quite common, so you should learn them well.</p>
