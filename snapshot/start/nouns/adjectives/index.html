<h1>Adjectives</h1>
<p class="alternatives">Also known as: <span lang="sa">viśeṣaṇa</span> ("qualification")</h5>

<p>So far, the nouns we've seen don't have very much detail. To add more detail to these nouns, we add descriptive words like "happy" or "sad." These words are called <dfn>adjectives</dfn>. They are called adjectives because they are directed ("ject," as in "projectile") at ("ad") the nouns they describe.</p>

<h2>Formation</h2>
<p>An adjective <a href="index">agrees</a> with its noun in number and grammatical case. To show this agreement, we inflect the adjective just like a noun. For example, consider the word <span lang="sa">sundara</span>, meaning "beautiful," in the sentences below:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>सुन्दरो</strong> नरो ऽश्वं गच्छति</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>sundaro</strong> naro 'śvaṃ gacchati</p>
	<p>The <strong>beautiful</strong> man goes to the horse.</p>
</li>
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>सुन्दरं</strong> नरो ऽश्वं गच्छति</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>sundaraṃ</strong> naro 'śvaṃ gacchati</p>
	<p>The man goes to the <strong>beautiful</strong> horse.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As you see above, adjectives do not have to appear right next to the noun they modify. Here are some other properties of adjectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We can use <strong>more than one</strong> adjective to describe a word.</li>
	<li>We can use an adjective <strong>without a noun</strong>.</li>
	<li>We can use <strong>pronouns as adjectives</strong>. When used this way, the pronoun means something like "that" or "this."</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties are demonstrated in the sentence below. This sentences uses two additional adjectives: <span lang="sa">priya</span> ("dear", "beloved") and <span lang="sa">kṛṣṇa</span> ("black").</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>कृष्णं स प्रियो</strong> ऽश्वं पश्यति <strong>सुन्दरम्</strong></p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>kṛṣṇaṃ sa priyo</strong> 'śvaṃ paśyati <strong>sundaram</strong></p>
	<p><strong>That beloved one</strong> sees the <strong>beautiful black</strong> horse.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If an adjective seems to agree with multiple nouns, the adjective usually describes the noun that's closest to it.</p>

<h2><span lang="sa">-n</span> Sandhi</h2>
<p>Sanskrit students usually have two main problems with sandhi. The first is the issue of <span lang="sa">visarga</span> sandhi. By approaching <span lang="sa">visarga</span> sandhi correctly, we defused the issue and reduced its seemingly bizarre behavior to a few simple rules. The second is the issue of <dfn lang="sa">-n sandhi</dfn>. Here, we will do the same; with a careful approach, we will reduce an intimidating set of rules to something as easy as <span lang="sa">visarga</span> sandhi.</p>

<p>To start, here is a broader principle that will help us make the rules of <span lang="sa">-n</span> sandhi much simpler:</p>

<p class="rule box">An "s"-sound cannot be between two voiced consonants.</p>

<p>Why is this principle helpful to us? Well, the answer is that the <span lang="sa">-n</span> ending was originally <span lang="sa">*-ns</span>, where the star ( <dfn>*</dfn> ) indicates a hypothetical form that has never been seen in real Sanskrit. By keeping this hypothetical <span lang="sa">*-ns</span> and the principle above in mind, we can reduce the complexities of <span lang="sa">-n</span> sandhi greatly.</p>

<p>Now, let's begin.</p>

<h3>Change to an "s"-sound</h3>
<p class="rule box">In front of an <strong>unvoiced stop</strong>, <span lang="sa">-n</span> becomes <span lang="sa">ṃ</span> plus the "s"-sound that best matches the consonant.</p>

<p>The <span lang="sa">s</span> of <span lang="sa">*-ns</span> changes to the "s"-sound that matches it the most, if that "s"-sound exists. Generally, <span lang="sa">ns</span> is written as <span lang="sa">ṃs</span> in Sanskrit.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">अश्वान् चरन्ति → अश्वांश् चरन्ति</p>
	<p lang="sa">aśvān caranti → aśvāṃś caranti</p>
	<p>They walk to the horses.</p>
</li>
	<li><p class="dev">नरान् तुदन्त्य् → नरांस् तुदन्ति</p>
	<p lang="sa">narān tudanty → narāṃs tudanti</p>
	<p>They strike the horses.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Change in point of pronunciation</h3>
<p>It's cumbersome to write this rule out, so just take a look at the table below:</p>
<dl lang="sa" class="blue">
	<dt lang="en" class="title">Second Letter</dt><dd lang="en" class="title">Combination</dd>
	<dt>j, jh</dt><dd>ñ —</dd>
	<dt>ḍ, ḍh</dt><dd>ṇ —</dd>
	<dt>ś</dt><dd>ñ — <span lang="en">(same change as with <span lang="sa">j/jh</span>)</span></dd>
</dl>

<p>Of the five changes described above, the first four are easiest to understand. The <span lang="sa">s</span> of <span lang="sa">*-ns</span>, since it appears between two voiced consonants, is removed. This leaves us with the <span lang="sa">-n</span> ending that we recognize. These four stop consonants all force us to move our tongue even as we pronounce the "n" sound, so it makes sense that <span lang="sa">n</span> would change to better fit to these letters. In fact, this is part of a larger principle of consonant sandhi:</p>

<p class="rule box">Consonants will change to better match their surroundings.</p>

<p>But what about <span lang="sa">-n</span>'s funny relation to <span lang="sa">ś</span>? Why is <span lang="sa">ṣ</span> excluded from this rule? This is my guess: since the "s" sounds that follow <span lang="sa">*-ns</span> are unvoiced, the <span lang="sa">s</span> of <span lang="sa">*-ns</span> acts as a "buffer," which protects <span lang="sa">n</span> from the effects of the sounds that follow. But since <span lang="sa">ś</span> can be pronounced without moving the tongue much from the <span lang="sa">-n</span> position, <span lang="sa">n</span> becomes <span lang="sa">ñ</span> to match it anyway.</p>

<p>Finally, here are some examples:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">नरान् जयामि → नराञ् जयामि</p>
	<p lang="sa">narān jayāmi → narāñ jayāmi</p>
	<p>I defeat the men.</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev">नरान् शोचथ → नराञ् शोचथ</p>
	<p lang="sa">narān śocatha → narāñ śocatha</p>
	<p>You all grieve the men. (the object case is used here to indicate the thing that is grieved for)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We only have one more change to cover, and it's an easy one:</p>

<h3>Change to a nasal "l"</h3>

<p class="rule box">In front of <span lang="sa">l</span>, <span lang="sa">n</span> becomes a nasal <span lang="sa">l</span>.</p>

<p>When we studied the Sanskrit sounds, I did not mention that some non-nasal sounds can become <dfn>nasalized</dfn>. Nasalized sounds are very common in Vedic literature, but they appear much less commonly in the later Sanskrit literature that we're preparing to read. The nasal <span lang="sa">l</span> is an exception.</p>

<p>In order to best blend with the <span lang="sa">l</span> sound of it after it, <span lang="sa">n</span> becomes an <span lang="sa">l</span> sound itself. But since <span lang="sa">n</span> is a nasal sound in origin, it retains its nasal quality to become a nasal <span lang="sa">l</span>.</p>

<p> In IAST, the nasal <span lang="sa">l</span> is usually written as <span lang="sa-iast">ṃl</span>. This combination should be read as a single sound, <strong>not</strong> as two. In Devanagari, the nasal <span lang="sa">l</span> is indicating by writing <dfn class="dev">ँ</dfn> over the vowel before it. This symbol is called the <dfn lang="sa">candra-bindu</dfn>, or "moon and dot."</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">नरः गजान् लिखति → नरो गजाँल् लिखति</p>
	<p lang="sa">naraḥ gajān likhati → naro gajāṃl likhati</p>
	<p>The man scratches the elephants.</p>
	<p>(<span lang="sa">lekh</span> is an <span lang="sa">a0</span> verb that means "scratch.")</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>No change</h3>
<p class="rule box">Otherwise, <span lang="sa">n</span> remains the same.</p>

<p>The "s" of the <span lang="sa">*-ns</span> ending cannot easily blend with the sounds that follow it, so it is dropped entirely. Since external sandhi changes do not happen twice in the same spot &mdash; as we see in examples like <span lang="sa">te icchati</span> or <span lang="sa">naraḥ icchati</span> &mdash; <span lang="sa">n</span> does not change further.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">नरान् अश्वः पश्यति → नरान् अश्वः पश्यति</p>
	<p lang="sa">narān aśvaḥ paśyati → narān aśvaḥ paśyati</p>
	<p>The horse sees the men.</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev">अहम् गजान् विन्दामि → अहं गजान् विन्दामि</p>
	<p lang="sa">aham gajān vindāmi → ahaṃ gajān vindāmi</p>
	<p>I find the elephants.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>With a little help from the older <span lang="sa">*-ns</span> ending, we simplified the problem of <span lang="sa">-n</span> sandhi into something that's a little easier to understand. You can see the changes below. The dash (<dfn>&mdash;</dfn>) shows that the second letter remains the same.</p>
