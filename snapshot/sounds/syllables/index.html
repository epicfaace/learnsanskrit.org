<h1>Syllables</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The sounds of a language are arranged into packets called <dfn>syllables</dfn>, which are pieces of sound that have <strong>exactly one vowel</strong>. The syllable relies on the vowel to be pronounced. This is part of the reason why the consonants were followed by <span lang="sa">a</span> in our lessons on consonants; consonants without vowels are difficult to say!</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>For some of you, the concept of a syllable might be straightforward. Others of you might not know what a syllable is, or perhaps you've forgotten. Regardless of your familiarity, you should read and understand the rules below. (There's no need to memorize them because you can probably figure out all of them through trial and error.) Each rule is followed with some examples of sounds that <em>are</em> syllables and sounds that are <em>not</em> syllables. To start:</p>

<p>A syllable must have a vowel, and it must have <strong>only one</strong> vowel.</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li>Syllables: <span lang="sa">a, ā, ki, ye, o, ghai, au</span></li>
		<li>Not syllables: <span lang="sa">k, r, oa, ua, ia, y, l, ava</span></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>When the <span lang="sa">anusvāra</span> or <span lang="sa">visarga</span> appears, it ends the syllable.</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li>Syllables: <span lang="sa">aṃ, kaṃ, kāṃ, aḥ, kaḥ, kāḥ</span></li>
		<li>Not syllables: <span lang="sa">ṃa, ḥa</span></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>A syllable must always start with a consonant. However, a syllable can start with a vowel <strong>only if</strong> one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The syllable is <em>at the beginning of a line.</em></li>
	<li>The syllable <em>follows a consonant that is removed due to a special rule.</em> This rule probably doesn't make much sense now. Ignore it for now.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>In the examples below, I've used multiple syllables. I've separated these syllables with a "-" sign. These examples also feature some of the mistakes you might make when dividing something into syllables.</span></p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li>Correct: <span lang="sa">tvā-ma-haṃ-śṛ-ṇo-mi</span></li>
		<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa"><strong>tvām-a</strong>-haṃ-śṛ-ṇo-mi</span></li>
		<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa">tvā-<strong>mah-aṃ</strong>-śṛ-ṇo-mi</span></li>
		<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa">tvā-ma-haṃ-<strong>śṛṇ-o</strong>-mi</span></li>
		<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa">tvā-ma-haṃ-śṛ-<strong>ṇom-i</strong></span></li>
	</ul>
<p>A syllable can end in any number of consonants; but if a stop or nasal appears, it must end the syllable. (This explanation is non-traditional, but it is much easier to understand.)</p>
<ul class="examples">
	<li>Correct: <span lang="sa">kṛt-snam</span></li>
	<li>Correct: <span lang="sa">kārt-snyā</span></li>
	<li>Correct: <span lang="sa">man-tri-tam</span></li>
	<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa"><strong>kṛts-nam</strong></span></li>
	<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa"><strong>kārtsn-yā</strong></span></li>
	<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa"><strong>mant-ri-tam</strong></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="fact box">The traditional explanation is that syllables never end in consonants, if possible. Thus <span lang="sa">mantritam</span> would be <span lang="sa">ma-ntri-tam</span>. This fact is reflected in Devanagari, as we will see later on.</p>

<h2>Light and Heavy Syllables</h2>
<p>A syllable that ends in a short vowel is called <dfn>light</dfn>. All other syllables are called <dfn>heavy</dfn>. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li>Light: <span lang="sa">a, ka, ra, hu, dhi, khṛ, ni</span></li>
	<li>Heavy: <span lang="sa">ar, kap, kā, kāp, ā, ār, kār, aḥ, ghaḥ, gāḥ, aṃ, naṃ, kaṃ</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In a syllable, all consonants are treated equally. Voice and aspiration do not matter; both <span lang="sa">ta</span> and <span lang="sa">dha</span> are light syllables.</p>

<p class="fact box">In Sanskrit, light syllables are called <dfn lang="sa">laghu</dfn> and heavy syllables are called <dfn lang="sa">guru</dfn>. <span lang="sa">laghu</span> means "light" and is related to the English word "light." Meanwhile, <span lang="sa">guru</span> means "heavy" and is related to the English word "grave," as in "a grave (or heavy) situation." So, this notion of syllables having "weight" is cross-cultural!</p>

<h2>Analyzing Syllables</h2>
<p>As we read each line, we should make each syllable as large as possible. But, we cannot break our rules above.</p>
<ul class="examples">
	<li>Correct: <span lang="sa">ad-yaus, ā-sa, sa-mā-sa, kṛt-snam</span></li>
	<li>Not Correct: <span lang="sa"><strong>a-dyaus</strong>, <strong>ās-a</strong>, <strong>sam-ā</strong>-sa, <strong>kṛts-nam</strong></span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Two Extended Examples</h2>
<p>I'd like to convince you that it's important to know the difference between heavy and light syllables. Let's look at an example by <dfn>Kalidasa</dfn> (more correctly <span lang="sa">kālidāsa</span>), the famous Sanskrit poet and dramatist. One of his most famous works is the <dfn lang="sa-iast">Meghaduta</dfn> (<span lang="sa">meghadūta</span>), a lyric poem about a lover who longs for his faraway beloved and asks a passing cloud to travel through India to give a message to her. Consider the first two lines of the poem:</p>

<ul lang="sa" class="examples">
	<li>kaścit kāntāvirahaguruṇā svādhikārapramattaḥ</li>
	<li>śāpenāstaṃgamitamahimā varṣabhogyeṇa bhartuḥ</li>
</ul>

<p>Are these syllables arranged randomly? Not quite. For one, we can tell that there are 17 syllables in each line. But we can also reveal more patterns by splitting each line into separate syllables. We do so by moving from the beginning of a line to the end. Remember that only the first syllable can start with a vowel; all others <em>must</em> start with consonants.</p>

<p>Let's start dividing these two lines into syllables. The first line starts with <span lang="sa">k</span>, and we continue to the vowel, which is <span lang="sa">a</span>. So far, we have <span lang="sa">ka</span>, but we must not stop here! We must make the syllable as large as possible, so we include the  <span lang="sa">ś</span> as well. But, we can't include the <span lang="sa">c</span>; if we did so, then the next syllable would start with a vowel, which is not allowed. So, we have <span lang="sa">kaś</span> as our final result.</p>

<p>In this way, we can proceed to separate the entire verse into syllables, as you see below.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p lang="sa">kaś-cit-kān-tā-vi-ra-ha-gu-ru-ṇās-vā-dhi-kā-rap-ra-mat-taḥ</p>
	<p>— — — — . . . . . — — . — — . — —</p>
	<p>(<dfn>—</dfn> is heavy, <dfn>.</dfn> is light.)</p></li>
	<li><p lang="sa">śā-pe-nās-taṃ-ga-mi-ta-ma-hi-mā-var-ṣa-bhog-ye-ṇa-bhar-tuḥ</p>
	<p>— — — — . . . . . — — . — — . — —</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These two lines use the same arrangement of syllables! We can also say that they have the same <dfn>meter</dfn>. From our short study on syllables, we can more directly see why Kalidasa decided to use this meter. It steps slowly through the heavy syllables before dashing through the light ones and swaying between them at the end. It produces a sinuous and disarming mood that fits perfectly with the poem.</p>

<p class="note box">The details of Sanskrit meter are not featured in this guide. However, this guide does feature some supplemental lessons that discuss meter in more detail. You can access these lessons from the "Review" page at the end of each chapter.</p>

<p>We can also separate the syllables of more fluid poems, like the famous Bhagavad Gita. Consider the lines below. Some of the lines have spaces in them; these are irrelevant when it comes to splitting lines into syllables, and you should ignore them.</p>

<ul class="examples" lang="sa">
	<li>dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ</li>
	<li>māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāścaiva kim akurvata saṃjaya</li>
</ul>

<p>By the same process, we get the division below. The pattern here is more subtle:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p lang="sa">dhar-mak-ṣet-re-ku-ruk-ṣet-re sa-ma-ve-tā-yu-yut-sa-vaḥ</p>
	<p>— — — — <strong>. — —</strong> — . . — — <strong>. — .</strong> —</p></li>
	<li><p lang="sa">mā-ma-kāḥ-pāṇ-ḍa-vāś-cai-va ki-ma-kur-va-ta-saṃ-ja-ya</p>
	<p>— . — — <strong>. — —</strong> . . . — . <strong>. — .</strong> .</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first verse of the Bhagavad Gita. Although each line here is shorter, the relationship between lines is not as clear as for the lines of the Meghaduta. Here is a very literal translation of the four lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>
	On the dharma-field, on the Kuru-field, assembled together, wanting to fight,<br />
	my (sons) and (the) Pandavas, what did they do, Sanjaya?
</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, more poetically:</p>

<blockquote><p>
	On dharma's field, the field of Kurus, all assembled wanting war<br />
	were my sons and the Pandavas. What did they do, O Sanjaya?
</p></blockquote>

<p>If you know nothing about the Bhagavad Gita, do not be afraid! A summary of the text is given in the next lesson.</p></div>
