<h1>Vowel Sandhi</h1>

<p class="note box">This lesson is for those who have finished <a href="/nouns">Nouns</a>.</p>

<p>This lesson uses the word <span lang="sa">pūrvapara</span>, meaning "the earlier and next." It is always used in the dual.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this supplemental lesson, we'll study some of the rules of external vowel sandhi. These rules give us a chance to see an actual example of how Panini's rules interact with each other. We'll also be able to study how Panini describes the rules of <dfn>substitution</dfn>. In substitution, one item is replaced by another.</p>

<p>We can describe a substitution based on what comes before it and what comes after it. Indeed, this is exactly how Panini describes it. He gives the grammatical cases specialized meanings that concisely describe a substitution:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Case 1 marks the substitute.</li>
	<li>Case 6 marks the thing that is removed due to substitution.</li>
	<li>Case 5 marks the thing that appears before the substitution.</li>
	<li>Case 7 marks the thing that appears after the substitution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through our study of the first two rules of the Ashtadhyayi, we could see some of the principles at play within the work. In this lesson, we will look at four more. An extra four rules are featured at the end of this lesson so that you can practice reading the Ashtadhyayi on your own.</p>

<h2>6.1.77 &mdash; Our first substitution rule</h2>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">इको यणचि</p>
<p lang="sa">iko yaṇaci</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Undoing the sandhi, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">इकः यण् अचि</p>
<p lang="sa">ikaḥ yaṇ aci</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The rule consists of three <span lang="sa">pratyāhāra</span>s: <span lang="sa">ik</span> in case 6, <span lang="sa">yaṇ</span> in case 1, and <span lang="sa">ac</span> in case 7. We have a case 6 noun and a case 1 noun. That almost certainly means that <span lang="sa">ikaḥ yaṇ aci</span> is a substitution rule. If we didn't understand how Panini uses grammatical case, we would read the rule as <q>In <span lang="sa">ac</span>, there is <span lang="sa">yaṇ</span> of <span lang="sa">ik</span>.</q> Fortunately, we know a bit about Panini's system. So, we should read the rule like this: <q>Before <span lang="sa">ac</span>, <span lang="sa">ik</span> becomes <span lang="sa">yaṇ</span>.</q></p>

<p><span lang="sa">ik</span> refers to <span lang="sa">i, ī, u, ū, ṛ, ṝ, </span> and <span lang="sa">ḷ</span>. <span lang="sa">yaṇ</span> refers to <span lang="sa">y, r, l,</span> and <span lang="sa">v</span>. <span lang="sa">ac</span> refers to all of the vowels. So, the rule says that the <span lang="sa">ik</span> vowels become semivowels when in front of any vowel. This is related to the general principle of vowel sandhi: <q>two vowels should not be next to each other.</q></p>

<p class="note box">Why does <span lang="sa">ik</span> have to be in case 6? The short answer: because <q>Panini is slick, but he isn't mean.</q> If <span lang="sa">ik</span> were in case 5, the rule wouldn't make any sense.</p>

<p>This rule, though, is incomplete. For example, consider the sentence <span lang="sa">gacchati iti</span>. Here, <span lang="sa">gacchatyiti</span> is incorrect and <span lang="sa">gacchatīti</span> is correct &mdash; but the rule predicts the incorrect result. How does Panini fix this problem? To find out, we have to keep reading through the Ashtadhyayi and look for an exception. But before we find that exception, we find a strange rule &hellip;</p>

<h2>6.1.84 &mdash; A strange rule</h2>
<p>Chapter 6, section 1, rule 84. What does this rule mean?</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">एकः पूर्वपरयोः</p>
	<p lang="sa">ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are two words here. Neither one is a technical term. First, we have <span lang="sa">eka</span>, meaning "one" or "a single," in case 1. Next, we have <span lang="sa">pūrvapara</span>, meaning "the earlier and the next," in case 6. We have a case 6 noun and a case 1 noun. That almost certainly means that <span lang="sa">ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ</span> is a substitution rule. But a substitution of <em>what?</em> It doesn't specify.</p>

<p>Let's try translating the rule. Literally, it reads like this: "There is one of the earlier and next." But we must remember how Panini uses grammatical case. With that fact in mind, we can more usefully write the rule like this: "One term is substituted for both the term before and the term after." This rule doesn't describe any real Sanskrit, and its meaning is too specific to be a <span lang="sa">paribhāṣā</span> rule. Therefore, this is likely an <span lang="sa">adhikāra</span> rule. Indeed, that's what it is; this seemingly vague rule actually describes the ones that follow it. It tells us that the rules that follow will specify a substitution of one term for two. The "before" means that one word will be in case 5, and the "after" means that one word will be in case 7. You'd have to read the actual Ashtadhyayi to understand how large the <span lang="sa">anuvṛtti</span> of this rule really is; but, I will say that it extends to the next rule, which finally defines the exception to 6.1.77 above.</p>

<h2>6.1.101 &mdash; <span lang="sa">niyama</span></h2>
<p>This is a <span lang="sa">niyama</span> rule that restricts the extent of 6.1.77.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः</p>
	<p lang="sa">akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This rule consists of three words: the <span lang="sa">pratyāhāra ak</span>, the technical term <span lang="sa">savarṇa</span> in case 7, and the technical term <span lang="sa">dīrgha</span> in case 1. <span lang="sa">ak</span> could be in either case 5 or case 6; but by our <span lang="sa">adhikāra</span> rule, we know it must be in case 5. So, the rule means something like this: <q>When <span lang="sa">ak</span> is followed by <span lang="sa">savarṇa</span>, both are replaced by <span lang="sa">dīrgha</span>.</q></p>

<p>What is <span lang="sa">savarṇa</span>? The word literally means "of the same color" and more metaphorically means "similar." <span lang="sa">savarṇa</span> generally describes sounds that are homogeneous. Here, it more specifically describes similar vowels. So, <span lang="sa">savarṇa</span> should be translated here as "a similar vowel."</p>

<p>What is <span lang="sa">ak</span>? As mentioned above, it is a <span lang="sa">pratyāhāra</span>. It describes all of the "simple" or "pure" vowels &mdash; that is, every vowel except for <span lang="sa">e, ai, o,</span> and <span lang="sa">au</span>. So, <span lang="sa">ak</span> should be translated here as "a simple vowel."</p>

<p>What is <span lang="sa">dīrgha</span>? The word literally means "long," and it refers to the long simple vowels. Since this word is in case 1, it specifies the term that should be substituted. So, <span lang="sa">dīrghaḥ</span> should be translated here as "A long vowel."</p>

<p>We can put these translations together and smooth out the English to get this: "When a simple vowel is followed by a similar vowel, both are replaced by a long vowel."</p>

<h2>1.1.50 &mdash; Fixing a serious problem</h2>

<p>Some of you might have noticed that there are a few problems with the rules above. These problems are quite subtle, and it's possible that they escaped your attention: <em>the rules above aren't very rigorous.</em> The first rule doesn't specify which semivowel to use, and the second rule doesn't specify which long vowel is substituted. By the second rule, <span lang="sa">gacchati iti</span> could easily become <span lang="sa">gacchatṝti</span> or something equally bizarre! How do we know which sound we should use in our substitution?</p>
</ul>

<p>It's tempting to answer both of these problems by saying that we should just use common sense. But the problem with this answer is that it's difficult to agree on exactly what "common" sense is. Panini realized this and left little room for ambiguous expressions. This is why <span lang="sa">paribhāṣā</span> rules exist. Let's look at the <span lang="sa">paribhāṣā</span> rule that applies here.</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">स्थाने ऽन्तरतमः</p>
<p lang="sa">sthāne 'ntaratamaḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Undoing the sandhi, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">स्थाने अन्तरतमः</p>
<p lang="sa">sthāne antaratamaḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This word consists of two words: the technical term <span lang="sa">sthāna</span> in case 7 and the adjective <span lang="sa">antaratama</span> in case 1. There is no noun in case 6, so this is not a rule of substitution.</p>

<p>Here, <span lang="sa">sthāna</span> is a neuter noun referring to the "space" or "room" in which we substitute. For example, the last <span lang="sa">i</span> of <span lang="sa">gacchati iti</span> is the <span lang="sa">sthāna</span>. Since this rule doesn't deal with substitution, case 7 doesn't have any special sense of "after," and it has the ordinary meaning of "in." Meanwhile, <span lang="sa">antaratama</span> is an adjective meaning the "nearest" or "most likely." This rule, then, is simple. It says: <q>In a <span lang="sa">sthāna</span>, use the nearest replacement.</q> Less literally, it says this: <q>When substituting, the most likely substitute is the right one.</q></p>

<p>Going back to <span lang="sa">gacchati iti</span>, we see that <span lang="sa">gacchatṝti</span> is still possible. However, this rule tells us to use the most likely replacement, which is <span lang="sa">gacchatīti</span>.</p>

<p class="fact box">Some of you may still feel unsatisfied at the use of the vague phrase "most likely." But Panini elaborates on this term in another part of his grammar, leaving no doubt as to what he means by the phrase.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>Now that you're more familiar with how these rules relate to each other, see if you can understand these rules on your own. I'll give you some hints. Using these hints, try to translate the rule. My translations, which are not literal, are further down the page.</p>

<h3>6.1.78</h3>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">एचो ऽयवायावः</p>
<p lang="sa">eco 'yavāyāvaḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Undoing the sandhi, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">एचो ऽयवायावः</p>
<p lang="sa">ecaḥ ayavāyāvaḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This rule, following the rule <span lang="sa">iko yaṇaci</span>, keeps the sense of the word <span lang="sa">aci</span>. <span lang="sa">ayavāyāv</span> is a compound word that should be read as <span lang="sa">ay-av-āy-āv</span>, and it is used in the plural. There is a direct correspondence between the terms in <span lang="sa">ec</span> and the terms in <span lang="sa">ayavāyāv</span>.</p>

<h3>6.1.87</h3>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">आद्गुणः</p>
<p lang="sa">ādguṇaḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Undoing the sandhi, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">आत् गुणः</p>
<p lang="sa">āt guṇaḥ</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This rule keeps the sense of the word <span lang="sa">aci</span> from 6.1.77. <span lang="sa">āt</span> is tricky. It can't be the noun <span lang="sa">āt</span> in case 1 (why not?); instead, it's the case 5 singular form of the noun <span lang="sa">a</span>, which stands for both <span lang="sa">a</span> and <span lang="sa">ā</span>.</p>

<h3>6.1.88</h3>
<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">वृद्धिरेचि</p>
<p lang="sa">vṛddhireci</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Undoing the sandhi, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev">वृद्धिः एचि</p>
<p lang="sa">vṛddhiḥ eci</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This rule is an exception to 6.1.87. But a case 5 term has to be replaced, too &mdash; what is that term?</p>

<h3>6.1.91</h3>
<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">उपसर्गादृति धातौ</p>
	<p lang="sa">upasargādṛti dhātau</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Undoing the sandhi, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">उपसर्गात् ऋति धातौ</p>
	<p lang="sa">upasargāt ṛti dhātau</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The term <span lang="sa">upasarga</span> refers to a verb prefix. The term <span lang="sa">dhātu</span> refers to a verb root. The rule keeps the sense of the word <span lang="sa">āt</span> from 6.1.87.</p>

<h3>Answers</h3>
<p>6.1.78: <q>When in front of any vowel, these changes occur: <span lang="sa">e</span> becomes <span lang="sa">ay</span>, <span lang="sa">o</span> becomes <span lang="sa">av</span>, <span lang="sa">ai</span> becomes <span lang="sa">āy</span>, and <span lang="sa">au</span> becomes <span lang="sa">āv</span>.</q> This is a normal vowel sandhi rule. There is a <span lang="sa">niyama</span> rule later on that changes its behavior when in external sandhi.</p>

<p>6.1.87: <q>When <span lang="sa">a</span> or <span lang="sa">ā</span> is in front of a vowel, both are replaced by <span lang="sa">guṇa</span>.</q> By interpretation, we know that they are replaced by the <span lang="sa">guṇa</span> of the vowel after <span lang="sa">a</span>. <span lang="sa">āt</span> cannot be the case 1 singular of <span lang="sa">āt</span>; if it were, the rule would be a redefinition of the term <span lang="sa">guṇa</span>. Moreover, a redefinition doesn't make much sense because this rule is within the <span lang="sa">anuvṛtti</span> of 6.1.84: <q>One term is substituted for both the term before and the term after.</q></p>

<p>6.1.88: This rule keeps the <span lang="sa">āt</span> term from the rule before. Because of that, we get this rule: <q>When <span lang="sa">a</span> or <span lang="sa">ā</span> is in front of a <span lang="sa">guṇa</span> vowel, both are replaced by <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>.</q> By interpretation, we know that they are replaced by the <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span> of the vowel after <span lang="sa">a</span>. </p>

<p>6.1.91: <q>When the <span lang="sa">a</span> or <span lang="sa">ā</span> of a verb prefix is followed by a root starting with <span lang="sa">ṛ</span>, both are replaced by <span lang="sa">vṛddhi</span>.</q> This is a <span lang="sa">niyama</span> rule. It is an exception to 6.1.78. Note that <span lang="sa">ṛt</span> refers to only one vowel: the short vowel <span lang="sa">ṛ</span>.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we explored how Panini gave the grammatical cases special meanings and used these meanings to concisely describe rules of substitution. We also saw several different types of rules and saw how pieces of one rule carry over to the next. So far, we've studied ten rules, or about 0.25% of the Ashtadhyayi. Yet in those ten rules we've seen some of the most significant parts of Panini's system.</p>

<p>But there is still a bit more to cover. In the next few lessons, we'll spend more time on the <span lang="sa">anubandha</span>. The <span lang="sa">anubandha</span> is not used just in the Shiva Sutras; rather, it is used throughout the Ashtadhyayi, and it is the source of almost all of the Ashtadhyayi's power.</p></div>
