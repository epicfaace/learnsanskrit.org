<h1>Relative Clauses</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Up until this point, we have studied very basic Sanskrit sentences. I don't mean that they are basic just because of our limited vocabulary or our lack of fancy verbs; I mean that they are basic because they are not powerful. We can describe the action of one subject, and we can chain several actions together with words like <span lang="sa">ca</span> and <span lang="sa">vā</span>; but ultimately, we're still just considering one subject and one action at a time. We have no good way to relate two ideas to each other.</p>

<p>There are simple sentences that we simply cannot say:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li>I go if you go.</li>
	<li>You smile when he stands.</li>
	<li>I go where you remember.</li>
	<li>You see the man who goes.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do we express ideas like these in Sanskrit? The answer is this: we split each sentence into two parts and use some new words to relate them. We usually call one part the <dfn>relative clause</dfn> because it is only important <em>relative</em> to the other part; here, the word <dfn>clause</dfn> means about the same thing as the word "sentence." We also call the other part the <dfn>correlative clause</dfn> because even though it can stand on its own, it must <em>correlate</em> with the relative clause.</p>

<p>We can write the first three sentences above in Sanskrit by using some new uninflected words. The last sentence requires a new pronoun.</p>

<h2>With Uninflected Words</h2>
<h3><span lang="sa">yadi</span> and <span lang="sa">tadā</span></h3>
<p>Here we'll handle the sentence "I go if you go." We can split this sentence into two distinct parts: "<span class="g">You go</span>" and "<span class="r">I go.</span>" We want to say "if <span class="g">you go</span>, then <span class="r">I go</span>."</p>

<p>To do so, we use two new uninflected words: <dfn lang="sa">yadi</dfn>, which means something like "if," and <dfn lang="sa">tadā</dfn>, which means something like "then." Each word appears in front of the clause that it describes.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>यदि</strong> गच्छसि <strong>तदा</strong> गच्छामि</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>yadi</strong> gacchasi <strong>tadā</strong> gacchāmi</p>
	<p><strong>If</strong> you go, <strong>then</strong> I go. (I go if you go.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span lang="sa">yadā</span> and <span lang="sa">tadā</span></h3>
<p><dfn lang="sa">yadā</dfn> means "when." It is used the same way as <span lang="sa">yadi</span>. <span lang="sa">tadā</span> still means "then."</p>
<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>यदा</strong> स तिष्ठति <strong>तदा</strong> त्वं हससि</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>yadā</strong> sa tiṣṭhati <strong>tadā</strong> tvaṃ hasasi</p>
	<p><strong>When</strong> he stands, <strong>then</strong> you smile. (You smile when he stands.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span lang="sa">yatra</span> and <span lang="sa">tatra</span></h3>
<p>As before, we can split the sentence into two parts. First, we have "<span class="g">you remember.</span>" Second, we have "<span class="r">I go.</span>" We want to say "where <span class="g">you remember</span>, there <span class="r">I go</span>."</p>

<p>To do so, we use these two words: <dfn lang="sa">yatra</dfn>, which means "where," and <dfn lang="sa">tatra</dfn>, which means "there." Each word appears in front of the clause that it describes.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>यत्र</strong> स्मरसि <strong>तत्र</strong> गच्छामि</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>yatra</strong> smarasi <strong>tatra</strong> gacchāmi</p>
	<p><strong>Where</strong> you remember, <strong>there</strong> I go. (I go where you remember.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Patterns</h3>
<p>Do you notice any patterns in these words? The relative word starts with <span lang="sa">ya</span> and the correlative part starts with <span lang="sa">ta</span>. All of these clauses follow this pattern. We just have to add the right suffix to create new words:</p>

<dl class="blue">
	<dt class="title">Suffix</dt><dd class="title">Meaning</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">tra</dt><dd>place ("where","there")</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">dā</dt><dd>time ("when","then")</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">taḥ</dt><dd>source ("whence/since", "thence/therefore")</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">thā</dt><dd>means ("in whatever way; just as &hellip;", "in such a way; so too &hellip;")</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that each of these suffixes loosely corresponds to a noun case: <span lang="sa">tra</span> is like case 7, <span lang="sa">dā</span> is roughly like case 7, <span lang="sa">taḥ</span> is like case 5, and <span lang="sa">thā</span> is roughly like case 3. <span lang="sa">tra</span> and <span lang="sa">taḥ</span>, especially, are very commonly used with this case meaning in mind. Thus the <i>Gita</i> has words like this:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">अयोगतः</p>
	<p lang="sa">ayogataḥ</p>
	<p>Not from yoga</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several other suffixes used, but these are the most common. <span lang="sa">yadi</span> is an exception of sorts.</p>

<h2>With A Pronoun</h2>

<p>By now you should have a good idea of how these "relative-correlative pairs" work with uninflected words. They work the same way with pronouns. However, it can be much trickier to use these pronouns, so we'll spend some more time on them.</p>

<h3><span lang="sa">yad</span> and <span lang="sa">tad</span></h3>
<p>For the correlative pronoun, we use <span lang="sa">tad</span>, which is the same <span lang="sa">tad</span> that we've been studying so far. For the relative pronoun, we use <dfn lang="sa">yad</dfn>, which uses the same endings as the pronoun <dfn lang="sa">tad</dfn>. But, the masculine case 1 singular (<span lang="sa">yaḥ</span>) doesn't follow the rules of <span lang="sa">saḥ</span> sandhi.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the sentence: <q>You see the man who goes.</q> As before, we have two separate situations. First, we have "The man goes." Second, we have "You see him."</p>

<p>How do we link these? We can construct the first separately: <span lang="sa">naro gacchati</span>. We can construct the second separately: <span lang="sa">taṃ paśyati</span>. What we do now is use <span lang="sa">yad</span> as an <strong>adjective to the relative clause's noun</strong>, which is <span lang="sa">naraḥ</span>. So, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>यो</strong> नरो गच्छति <strong>तं</strong> पश्यसि</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>yo</strong> naro gacchati <strong>taṃ</strong> paśyasi</p>
	<p>The man goes; you see him. (You see the man who goes.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span lang="sa">yad</span> part is almost like an adjective to the rest of the sentence; if it is removed, then the sentence still makes sense:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">तं पश्यति</p>
	<p lang="sa">taṃ paśyati</p>
	<p>You see him.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The use of relative pronouns is quite tricky, so let's study some more examples.</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>You go with the man who conquers the two horses.</li></ul>

<p>We have two situations here. First, we have "The man conquers the two horses." Second, we have "You go with him."</p>

<p>We can construct these two parts separately. The first: <span lang="sa">naro 'śvau jayati</span>. The second: <span lang="sa">tena gacchasi</span>. What we do now is use <span lang="sa">yad</span> as an adjective to the relative clause's noun, which is <span lang="sa">naraḥ</span>. So, we get the following:</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev"><strong>यो</strong> नरो ऽश्वौ जयति <strong>तेन</strong> गच्छसि</p>
<p lang="sa"><strong>yo</strong> naro 'śvau jayati <strong>tena</strong> gacchasi</p>
<p>The man conquers the two horses; you go with him. (You go with the man who conquers the two horses.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here you can see the power of this construction: <span lang="sa">yad</span> and <span lang="sa">tad</span> don't have to be in the same case! (But, they still must have the same number and gender!) The freedom from identical cases allows us to create compact and highly structured expressions.</p>

<p>Let's consider one last example:</p>

<ul class="examples"><li>They go with the hero whose son sings.</li></ul>

<p>We have two situations here. First, we have "The hero's son sings." Second, we have "They go with him."</p>

<p>We can construct these two parts separately. The first: <span lang="sa">vīrasya putro gāyati</span>. The second: <span lang="sa">tena gacchanti</span>. What we do now is use <span lang="sa">yad</span> as an adjective to <span lang="sa">vīrasya</span>. So, we get the following.</p>

<ul class="examples">
<li><p class="dev"><strong>यस्य</strong> वीरस्य पुत्रो गायति <strong>तेन</strong> गच्छन्ति</p>
<p lang="sa"><strong>yasya</strong> vīrasya putro gāyati <strong>tena</strong> gacchanti</p>
<p>The hero's son sings; they go with him. (They go with the hero whose son sings.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again: <span lang="sa">yad</span> and <span lang="sa">tad</span> don't have to be in the same case. However, they must have the same number and gender, since they still refer to the same noun.</p>

<h3>Where to put the noun that <span lang="sa">yad</span> describes</h3>
<p>The noun that <span lang="sa">yad</span> describes can appear on either side of the expression. In the examples above, I tend to put the noun in the relative part of the sentence; but, it is no harder to put it on the other side. In the examples below, I've taken the noun and put it on the <span lang="sa">tad</span> side instead of the <span lang="sa">yad</span> side.</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>यो</strong> गच्छति <strong>तं</strong> नरं पश्यसि</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>yo</strong> gacchati <strong>taṃ</strong> naraṃ paśyasi</p>
	<p>He goes; that man, you see. (You see the man who goes.)</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>यो</strong> ऽश्वौ जयति <strong>तेन</strong> नरेण गच्छसि</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>yo</strong> 'śvau jayati <strong>tena</strong> nareṇa gacchasi</p>
	<p>He conquers the two horses; you go with that man. (You go with the man who conquers the two horses.)</p></li>
	<li><p class="dev"><strong>यस्य</strong> पुत्रो गायति <strong>तेन</strong> वीरेण गच्छन्ति</p>
	<p lang="sa"><strong>yasya</strong> putro gāyati <strong>tena</strong> vīreṇa gacchanti</p>
	<p>His son sings; with the hero, they go. (They go with the hero whose son sings.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using These Pairs</h2>
<p>The relative word (<span lang="sa">ya&hellip;</span>) and the correlative word (<span lang="sa">ta&hellip;</span>) are almost always used together. But, the <span lang="sa">ta</span> word is occasionally left out. The <span lang="sa">ya&hellip;</span> part almost always appears first, but that's not a firm rule, and you should not be surprised to see it appear second instead of first.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we learned a set of words that can be used to define <strong>relative</strong> and <strong>correlative</strong> clauses. Sentences that have these clauses usually have this form:</p>

<ul class="examples">
	<li><p class="dev">य&hellip; त&hellip;</p>
	<p lang="sa">ya&hellip; ta&hellip;</p>
</ul>

<p>Incidentally, we learned that we can add suffixes to these two syllables to make more interesting words. Here are some of the suffixes we learned:</p>

<dl class="blue">
	<dt class="title">Suffix</dt><dd class="title">Meaning</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">tra</dt><dd>place ("where","there")</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">dā</dt><dd>time ("when","then")</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">taḥ</dt><dd>source ("whence/since", "thence/therefore")</dd>
	<dt lang="sa">thā</dt><dd>means ("in whatever way; just as &hellip;", "in such a way; so too &hellip;")</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are also several other suffixes, which denote other qualities like extent (how far), frequency (how often), manner (in what way), and so on. We'll learn these suffixes later on. Interestingly, many other sorts of nouns use them as well.</p></div>
